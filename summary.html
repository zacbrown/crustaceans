I am sitting in the room, at the British Standards Institution, where today&#8217;s meeting of IST/5, the committee responsible for programming languages, has just adjourned (it&#8217;s close to where I have to be in a few hours). BSI have downsized us, they no longer provide a committee secretary to take minutes and provide a point [&#8230;]</p>

<h4><a href="http://benaiah.me/posts/configuring-go-apps-with-toml">Configuring Go Apps with TOML</a></h4>
<p>
<h1>Configuring Go Apps with TOML</h1>
<p>So you’ve been writing an application in Go, and you’re getting to the
point where you have a lot of different options in your program.
You’ll likely want a configuration file, as specifying every option on
the command-line can get difficult and clunky, and launching
applications from a desktop environment makes specifying options at
launch even more difficult.</p>
<p>This post will cover configuring Go apps using a simple, INI-like
configuration language called <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>, as well as some related
difficulties and pitfalls.</p>
<p>TOML has quite a few implementations, including several libraries for
Go. I particularly like
<a href="https://github.com/burntsushi/toml">BurntSushi’s TOML parser and decoder</a>, as it lets
you marshal a TOML file directly into a struct. This means your
configuration can be fully typed and you can easily do custom
conversions (such as parsing a <code>time.Duration</code>) as you read the
config, so you don’t have to do them in the rest of your application.</p>
<h2>Configuration location</h2>
<p>The first question you should ask when adding config files to any app
is "where should they go?". For tools that aren’t designed to be run
as a service, as root, or under a custom user (in other words, most of
them), you should be putting them in the user’s home directory, so
they’re easily changed. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if you currently have only one file, you should use a folder
and put the config file within it. That way, if and when you do need
other files there, you won’t have to clutter the user’s home
directory or deal with loading config files that could be in two
different locations (Emacs, for instance, supports both
<code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> and <code>~/.emacs</code> for historical reasons, which
ends up causing confusing problems when both exist).</p></li>
<li><p>You should name your configuration directory after your program.</p></li>
<li><p>You should typically prefix your config directory with a <code>.</code> (but
see the final note for Linux, as configuration directories within
<code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> should not be so prefixed).</p></li>
<li><p>On most OSs, putting your configuration files in the user’s “home”
directory is typical. I recommend the library
<a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/go-homedir">go-homedir</a>, rather than the <code>User.Homedir</code> available
in the stdlib from <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/user/"><code>os/user</code></a>. This is because use of
<code>os/user</code> uses <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">cgo</a>, which, while useful in many situations,
also <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go">causes a number of difficulties</a> that can
otherwise be avoided - most notably, cross-compilation is no longer
simple, and the ease of deploying a static Go binary gets a number
of caveats.</p></li>
<li><p>On Linux specifically, I strongly encourage that you do <em>not</em> put
your configuration directory directly in the user’s home directory.
Most commonly-used modern Linux distributions use the
<a href="https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory Specification</a> from
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/">freedesktop.org</a>, which specifies standard locations
for various directories on an end-user Linux system. (Despite this,
many applications don’t respect the standard and put their
configurations directly in <code>~</code> anyway). By default, this is
<code>~/.config/</code>, but it can also be set with the <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>
environment variable. Directories within this should <em>not</em> use a
leading <code>.</code>, as the directory is already hidden by default.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following function should get you the correct location for your
config directory on all platforms (if there’s a platform with a
specific convention for config locations which I’ve missed, I’d
appreciate you letting me know so I can update the post - my email is
at the bottom of the page).</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    "path/filepath"
    "os"
    "runtime"

    "github.com/mitchellh/go-homedir"
)

var configDirName = "example"

func GetDefaultConfigDir() (string, error) {
    var configDirLocation string

    homeDir, err := homedir.Dir()
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    switch runtime.GOOS {
    case "linux":
        // Use the XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable if it is set, otherwise
        // $HOME/.config/example
        xdgConfigHome := os.Getenv("XDG_CONFIG_HOME")
        if xdgConfigHome != "" {
            configDirLocation = xdgConfigHome
        } else {
            configDirLocation = filepath.Join(homeDir, ".config", configDirName)
        }

    default:
        // On other platforms we just use $HOME/.example
        hiddenConfigDirName := "." + configDirName
        configDirLocation = filepath.Join(homeDir, hiddenConfigDirName)
    }

    return configDirLocation, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>Within the config folder, you can use any filename you want for your
config - I suggest <code>config.toml</code>.</p>
<h2>Loading the config file</h2>
<p>To load a config file, you’ll first want to define the what config
values you’ll use. <code>burntsushi/toml</code> will ignore options in the TOML
file that you don’t use, so you don’t have to worry about that causing
errors. For instance, here’s the proposed configuration for a project
I’m maintaining, <a href="https://github.com/asciimoo/wuzz">wuzz</a> (the keybindings aren’t currently
implemented, but I’ve left them in for the sake of demonstration):</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type Config struct {
    General GeneralOptions
    Keys    map[string]map[string]string
}

type GeneralOptions struct {
    FormatJSON             bool
    Insecure               bool
    PreserveScrollPosition bool
    DefaultURLScheme       string
}
</code></pre>
<p>It’s pretty simple. Note that we use a named struct for
<code>GeneralOptions</code>, rather than making <code>Config.General</code> an anonymous
struct. This makes nesting options simpler and aids tooling.</p>
<p>Loading the config is quite easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    "errors"
    "os"
    
    "github.com/BurntSush/toml"
)

func LoadConfig(configFile string) (*Config, error) {
    if _, err := os.Stat(configFile); os.IsNotExist(err) {
        return nil, errors.New("Config file does not exist.")
    } else if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    var conf Config
    if _, err := toml.DecodeFile(configFile, &amp;conf); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return &amp;conf, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>toml.DecodeFile</code> will automatically populate <code>conf</code> with the values
set in the TOML file. (Note that we pass <code>&amp;conf</code> to <code>toml.DecodeFile</code>,
not <code>conf</code> - we need to populate the struct we actually have, not a
copy). Given the above <code>Config</code> type and the following TOML file…</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[general]
defaultURLScheme = "https"
formatJSON = true
preserveScrollPosition = true
insecure = false

[keys]

  [keys.general]
  "C-j" = "next-view"
  "C-k" = "previous-view"
  
  [keys.response-view]
  "&lt;down&gt;" = "scroll-down"
</code></pre>
<p>…we’ll get a <code>Config</code> like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">Config{
    General: GeneralOptions{
        DefaultURLScheme:       "https",
        FormatJSON:             true,
        PreserveScrollPosition: true,
        Insecure:               false,
    },
    Keys: map[string]map[string]string{
        "general": map[string]string{
            "C-j": "next-view",
            "C-k": "previous-view",
        },
        "response-view": map[string]string{
            "&lt;down&gt;": "scroll-down",
        },
    },
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Automatically decoding values</h2>
<p><code>wuzz</code> actually uses another value in its config - a default HTTP
timeout. In this case, though, there’s no native TOML value that
cleanly maps to the type we want - a <code>time.Duration</code>. Fortunately, the
TOML library we’re using supports automatically decoding TOML values
into custom Go values. To do so, we’ll need a type that wraps
<code>time.Duration</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type Duration struct {
    time.Duration
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next we’ll need to add an <code>UnmarshalText</code> method, so we satisfy the
<code>toml.TextUnmarshaler</code> interface. This will let <code>toml</code> know that we
expect a string value which will be passed into our <code>UnmarshalText</code>
method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (d *Duration) UnmarshalText(text []byte) error {
    var err error
    d.Duration, err = time.ParseDuration(string(text))
    return err
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we’ll need to add it to our <code>Config</code> type. This will go in
<code>Config.General</code>, so we’ll add it to <code>GeneralOptions</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type GeneralOptions struct {
    Timeout                Duration
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can add it to our TOML file, and <code>toml.DecodeFile</code> will
automatically populate our struct with a <code>Duration</code> value!</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[general]
timeout = "1m"
# ...
</code></pre>
<p>Equivalent output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">Config{
    General: GeneralOptions{
        Timeout: Duration{
            Duration: 1 * time.Minute
        },
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Default config values</h2>
<p>We now have configuration loading, and we’re even decoding a text
field to a custom Go type - we’re nearly finished! Next we’ll want to
specify defaults for the configuration. We want values specified in
the config to override our defaults. Fortunately, <code>toml</code> makes really
easy to do.</p>
<p>Remember how we passed in <code>&amp;conf</code> to <code>toml.DecodeFile</code>? That was an
empty <code>Config</code> struct - but we can also pass one with its values
pre-populated. <code>toml.DecodeFile</code> will set any values that exist in the
TOML file, and ignore the rest. First we’ll create the default values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    "time"
)
var DefaultConfig = Config{
    General: GeneralOptions{
        DefaultURLScheme:       "https",
        FormatJSON:             true,
        Insecure:               false,
        PreserveScrollPosition: true,
        Timeout: Duration{
            Duration: 1 * time.Minute,
        },
    },
    // You can omit stuff from the default config if you'd like - in
    // this case we don't specify Config.Keys
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we simply modify the <code>LoadConfig</code> function to use
<code>DefaultConfig</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func LoadConfig(configFile string) (*Config, error) {
    if _, err := os.Stat(configFile); os.IsNotExist(err) {
        return nil, errors.New("Config file does not exist.")
    } else if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    conf := DefaultConfig
    if _, err := toml.DecodeFile(configFile, &amp;conf); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return &amp;conf, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>The important line here is <code>conf := DefaultConfig</code> - now when <code>conf</code>
is passed to <code>toml.DecodeFile</code> it will populate that.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I hope this post helped you! you should now be able to configure Go
apps using TOML with ease.</p>

<hr><h3 class="post"><a href="https://blog.artemix.org/" title="Artemis's blog. Development, security and more.">Artemis (Artemix)</a></h3>


<h4><a href="https://blog.artemix.org/article/show/kickstart">Kickstart, a fast and simple project template bootstrapper</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Ever had some code base that you regularly use to start a new project?</p>
<p>Until now, you've probably lost some time refactoring everything to fill out the right project name, title etc.</p>
<p>A few tools already exist but either you're lost in feature bloating hell or you're fighting to configure everything in most cases.</p>
<p>The following tool is an early-developement, rust-based, template tool made to be more versatile that its closest python counter-part, <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a>.</p>
<p>Also, it perfectly works on Windows, Linux and MacOS without any issue!</p>
<h2>A demonstration</h2>
<p>Let me demonstrate this tool from a user's point of view.</p>
<p>Say I'm John. I have a need to make several workers for my job queue.</p>
<p>All workers follow the same base structure and only a few bits of code change.
Error management is the same, etc.</p>
<p>Without any external tool,
the easiest way I could handle that would be to put the template in a Git repository,
clone it when needed and change the few fields,
like the handler's class name, the configuration file etc.</p>
<p>Still, I'd like to quickly bootstrap all my workers and not have to, by hand,
replace each key with the right value.</p>
<p>At the same time, I'm too lazy to set up an entire boostrapping suite or tool,
and I'd like to be able to make some very basic project templates that'd work almost out of the box.</p>
<p>My example of worker system uses the following file structure for worker classes:</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">.
├── {{name}}.java
└── template.toml</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, this tool supports templating in file and folder names!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>{{name}}.java</code> file contains the following very basic template code:</p>
<pre><code class="java">package org.artemix.worker;

class {{name}} extends WorkerBase {
        public void handle(Payload payload) {
                // Some default code
        }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>template.toml</code> contains a few template-specific fields (like its name, description and configuration format version), but also variable declaration for setup prompts.</p>
<pre><code class="toml">name = "Worker"
description = "Worker base template"
kickstart_version = 1

[[variable]]
name="name"
default="MyClass"
prompt="Which class name do you want to give to your worker ?"
validation="^[A-Z]\w+$"</code></pre>
<p>Here, with the validation regex, we can attest that we'll get a valid Java class file starting with a capitalized letter.</p>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>In a few instants, we created our worker template, and we have a nice base we can later grow if we need any new more complex worker.</p>
<p><em>Now, how do you create a worker with this template?</em></p>
<p>The easiest way is by simply running the following command from inside the folder in which you want the files to be created.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">$ kickstart /path/to/my/template</code></pre>
<p>This will parse the <code>template.toml</code> inside the given template path and,
for each <code>[[variable]]</code> block, will ask the prompt, validate the input,
and repeat until it's rightly entered.</p>
<p>Once all prompts have been resolved, it'll copy and parse the files into the current directory.</p>
<p><em>But I don't want to have all my templates in local, or pass the path every time!</em></p>
<p>Sure, having everything in local can be bothersome,
especially if you're starting a project from a huge project template.</p>
<p>To answer that, in the current version, kickstart supports cloning from a git remote by either HTTP(S), SSH or even git shortcuts!</p>
<p>In that sense, all the following commands are perfectly valid and will clone from a git remote.</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">$ kickstart git@gitlab.com:MyUser/MyTemplate
$ kickstart https://git.local/test
# With git shortcuts in the configuration, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/25975967/10165294
$ kickstart gl:MyUser/MyTemplate</code></pre>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>While still young, this tool is already, as-is, really useful and can handle a lot of situations.</p>
<p>Since the goal of this tool is to be as lightweight and basic as possible, you can have a fair
guarantee that it won't become an over-complex, feature-bloated, tool.</p>
<p>Not every feature has been showcased in this article, so I can only recommend you to go to the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/kickstart">official Github repository</a>,
and take a look at the <code>README.md</code> file, which should contains every information you'd need to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>As I publish this article, the official <code>v0.1.7</code> version have been released, and you can find the relesae on the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/kickstart/releases">releases page</a>.
If you'd prefer to be on the latest version, you can simply clone the repository, and, while inside it, run <code>cargo builld</code> and have a working version just for you.</p></p>

<h4><a href="https://www.junglecoder.com/blog/factorlang-review">Factor: An impressive stack-based language environment</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Recently the <a href="https://factorcode.org">Factor</a> programming language had a new 0.98 release, after a 4 year hiatus after the 0.97 release. Finding this on lobsters, I decided to take Factor for a spin again, after years of having left it mostly alone to work on PISC. I decided I wanted to try to build a (still slightly buggy) <a href="https://gist.github.com/yumaikas/6c8aebf8b0baf20431e06bd20c47dec4">4-function calculator</a>, as I find that a good way to gauge how easy/hard it is to use a GUI system for small things, and as a way to gauge what Factor is like in general.</p>

<h3>The (quite frankly) awesome</h3>

<p>Probably by <em>far</em> the most impressive part of Factor that I&rsquo;ve seen so far: Factor is the second language I&rsquo;ve come across that I&rsquo;d comfortably take on a deserted island without an internet connection (the other being Go with it&rsquo;s godoc server). This is due to the fact that a) 95% of all Factor documentation I&rsquo;ve seen is accessible from the included Help browser, and b) the Factor debugger/inspector can inspect itself in great detail. This is the cherry atop Factor: You don&rsquo;t just get a REPL, you also get a <em>really</em> useful set of debugging tools (especially the object inspector), and can dig into any of the state in the system, and using the help tools, once you understand some basics, you stand a decent chance of being able to either correct the state, or diagnose the bug.</p>

<p>This sort of tooling is something that SmallTalk is famous for, but any time I&rsquo;ve tried SmallTalk, I&rsquo;ve usually bounced off of it because most SmallTalk implementations end up living in their own world, making it hard to bring some of my favorite programming tools with me, and making it hard to interact with the outside world (footnote 3). Factor, on the other hand, even though it has an image that can updated to keep state around, and has a really good debugger, still integrates well with the outside world.</p>

<p>Really well, in fact. It&rsquo;s easy to scaffold a vocabulary <code>USE: tools.scaffold &quot;vocabulary-name&quot; scaffold-vocabulary</code> , and then run <code>USE: editors.sublime</code> (or emacs, or vim, or any of about 24 other fairly popular editors), and then run <code>&quot;vocabulary-name&quot; edit</code> and have it open the vocabulary in the editor in question. This allows you to open up any of the Factor source code in the editor of your choice. And when you&rsquo;re ready to start using/testing the vocabulary, running <code>&quot;vocabulary-name&quot; reload</code> puts you right into compile-fixing mode, where you can fix the bug in question, and then reload the vocabulary. When I was working on a 4-function calculator using the Factor listener and Sublime Text, it was a <em>really</em> tight feedback loop.</p>

<p>The GUI framework has a pretty nifty sorta-FRP like approach to how to handles data binding in controls, allowing you to daisy chain models (data that can be updated over time) via arrows (models with a quotation they apply to a base model when it&rsquo;s data changes).</p>

<p>Also, Factor has a mostly working dark-mode setup (there are some sections of the inspector that have poor contrast, but the listener is in a good state), if you dislike the default black-on-white color scheme (I found it difficult for some of the late night hacking I was doing). Run the following commands in the listener (assuming Factor 0.98)</p>

<pre><code>USE: tools.scaffold 
scaffold-factor-boot-rc
</code></pre>

<p>Then edit the .factor-boot-rc to look like so:</p>

<pre><code>USE: ui.theme.switching 

dark-mode
</code></pre>

<p>Then then run <code>run-bootstrap-init save</code> in the listener, and close and re-open the listener. Viola, Factor&rsquo;s dark mode!</p>

<h3>Consequences of (relative) obscurity</h3>

<p>That being said, there are still a few rough edges with Factor. For one, even though most things are documented, and those that are not have easily accessible source, Factor itself has almost no Google presence, which means that you have to be comfortable digging though the included help docs a bit longer to sort things out. This played out in a few practical ways when I was working on the 4-function calculator. Until the end of the project, I missed that <code>gadgets</code> (Factor&rsquo;s equivalent for controls in WinForms) were subclasses of <code>rectangles</code>, which meant that I could set their width and height by storing to the <code>dim</code>(ension) on a gadget:</p>

<pre><code class="factor">&quot;Test&quot; &lt;label&gt; { 200 300 } &gt;&gt;dim &quot;example of a 200x300 label&quot; open-window 
</code></pre>

<p>I ended up looking around the documentation about 4 times before I made that connection. This is the sort of question that would be on stack overflow for a more popular language.</p>

<p>For another, I seemed to be running across rendering or state glitches in the listener that could cause buttons to be mislabeled. I&rsquo;m unsure what was leading to it, but it was distracting, to say the least. The other thing with Factor that became evident was the singled threaded nature of it&rsquo;s runtime (as of currently). When first making a search in the help system, it would lock up, sometimes as long as 10-15 seconds, as it was indexing or loading in the various articles and such into memory. This limitation has kept me from digging into some languages (like Ocaml, though there are a bunch of other reasons, like iffy Windows support) in the past, especially when alternatives like Go and Erlang with their strong multi-threaded runtimes exist, but I think I&rsquo;m willing to look past it in Factor for now, especially since I hear that there is a half decent IPC story for Factor processes.</p>

<p>The other consequence of all this was that it took me roughly 10-15 hours of noodling around with Factor, and writing an even smaller example GUI script to be able to get the linked calculator above done. I think I could build other new things with far less stumbling around, but it was a good reminder of how slow learning something new can be.</p>

<p>The other minor frustration I have with Factor is the fact that any file that does much work tends to accrete quite a few imports in its <code>USING:</code> line (the calculator I wrote has 23 imports across 4 lines, even though it&rsquo;s only 100 lines of code). This is mostly due to a lot of various Factor systems being split into quite a few vocabularies. I could see this being helpful with compilation</p>

<h3>Comparisons to PISC</h3>

<p>Factor was a big inspiration for <a href="https://pisc.junglecoder.com/">Position Independent Source Code</a> (PISC), especially since it gave me the idea of code quotations some basic ideas for a few stack shuffling operations and some combinators (like <code>when</code> or <code>bi</code>). Factor and PISC have diverged a decent amount, though Factor is far and away further down the general path I&rsquo;d been wanting to take PISC in terms of documentation and interactivity. Revisiting it after spending 3 years of assorted free time working with PISC demonstrated that in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>Factor has a much higher level of introspection. When making the calculator I only had to think in Factor, rather than thinking in both PISC and Go (which is common when writing PISC). I also didn&rsquo;t have to rebuild many building blocks to get where I was going, like I would in PISC, as Slava and the other maintainers have done a <em>lot</em> of the foundational work already. Revisiting Factor after having written so much PISC did make understanding the stack a lot easier. I imagine that stack management will be most people&rsquo;s struggle with Factor. I&rsquo;ve found that implementing a stack language helped me there, but for some people, they may just have to do some exercises with it.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>I do anticipate building more side-projects in Factor, as I&rsquo;ve yet to try out the web framework, and I have a couple of ideas for websites in the back of my mind. There&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> of vocabularies that come with the base Factor download. I get the feeling that I may be adding some to it in the future, though time will tell.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/08/13/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/">Algorithmically Fingering Guitar Chords with Elixir</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Last time we wrote about using Elixir to generate all possible voicings of a given guitar chord <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">to find the voicing with the best voice leading between another chord</a>.</p>

<p>While this was great, there were several issues. We were conflating the idea of “musical distance” and “physical distance” when calculating optimal voice leading, and we weren’t taking the playability of the progressions we were generating into account.</p>

<p>To address both of these issues, we need to know not only <em>which</em> voicings are possible for a given chord, but also <em>how</em> each of those voicings can be played. We need to generate all possible fingerings for a given guitar chord voicing.</p>

<p>This sounds like a fantastic excuse to flex our Elixir muscles!</p>

<h2 id="calculating-fingerings">Calculating Fingerings</h2>

<p>We’ll start our journey into calculating all possible fingerings for a given guitar chord by creating a new Elixir module, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Fingering</span></code>, and a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord.Fingering do
  def fingerings(chord)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Our high level plan of attack for computing possible fingerings is fairly straight forward. Given that each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir#rendering-chords">a six-element array of frets being played</a>, like <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">]</span></code>, we want to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Attach all possible fingerings that can be played on each fret.</li>
  <li>Choose each possible finger in turn, sieve out all subsequent impossible fingers, and recursively repeat to get all possible fingerings.</li>
  <li>Perform any necessary cleanup.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our final <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function makes these steps fairly explicit:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def fingerings(chord),
  do:
    chord
    |&gt; attach_possible_fingers()
    |&gt; choose_and_sieve()
    |&gt; cleanup()
</code></pre>

<h2 id="possible-fingers-sieves">Possible Fingers? Sieves?</h2>

<p>Before we dive deeper into our solution, we should take a detour and talk about how we’re computing fingerings.</p>

<p>Our solution takes inspiration from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">“Sieve of Eratosthenes”</a>, which is a clever technique for calculating prime numbers. The basic idea of a “sieve” is that a choice made <em>now</em> can be used to filter out <em>future</em> unwanted results.</p>

<p>To bring it back to our situation, imagine we’re trying to play a D minor chord on the fifth fret:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/Dm.png" />
  <p>Our D minor chord.</p>
</div>

<p>If we were to start fingering this chord by placing our second finger on the low D note, we know that we couldn’t use our first finger on any of the other notes in the chord. Our first finger would have to wrap over or sneak under our second finger to reach those notes, and that’s essentially impossible:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/sieve.png" />
  <p>We can't use our first finger anywhere!</p>
</div>

<p>So by choosing to use our second finger on the fifth string and fret, we can sieve out the possibility of using our first finger on any of the remaining notes.</p>

<p>If we think about it, we can also sieve out the possibility of re-using our second finger. A finger can’t be re-used unless it’s forming a bar or a double-stop on an adjacent fret.</p>

<p>Our remaining set of possible fingers for the remaining notes are fingers three and four.</p>

<p>By recursively picking another of our possible fingers on another string and applying our sieving rules, we can come up with our entire set of possible fingers.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-and-sieving">Choosing and Sieving</h2>

<p>The meat of our algorithm lives in the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function, which takes an initial <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, complete with “possible fingers”, and a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> argument that defaults to an empty list:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve(chord, fingerings \\ [])
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> argument will be used to hold each finger choice for our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, as we choose them.</p>

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function expects each element of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> to be a two-element tuple, where the first element is the fret being played, and the second element is the set of possible fingers that could be chosen to play that fret.</p>

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">attach_possible_fingers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper function transforms our initial chord into that expected structure:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp attach_possible_fingers(chord),
  do: Enum.map(chord, &amp;{&amp;1, 1..4})
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Our implementation of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> is recursive, so we should start our implementation by defining our base case. The base case for <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> is triggered when <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is empty. At that point, we’ve handled every note in the chord, and need to return our fully constructed fingering:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([], fingerings),
  do:
    fingerings
    |&gt; Enum.reverse()
    |&gt; List.to_tuple()
</code></pre>

<p>As we’ll soon see, chosen fingers are appended onto <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> in reverse order, so we <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">reverse</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> our list to reorient our strings. Lastly we turn our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> list into a tuple so that we can safely <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">flatten</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> our resulting list of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> without losing our groupings.</p>

<p>Once flattened, our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">cleanup</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function maps over this final list and converts each tuple back into an array:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp cleanup(fingerings),
  do: Enum.map(fingerings, &amp;Tuple.to_list/1)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Moving on from our base case, it’s time to start thinking of other simple to handle situations.</p>

<p>If the next element in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> list is an unplayed string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>), we add it to our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> list and designate it to be played with no finger (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>), and recursively call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> on our remaining <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([{nil, _possible_fingers} | chord], fingerings),
  do: choose_and_sieve(chord, [{nil, nil} | fingerings])
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, if the next element of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is an open string, we’re recursively call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>, passing in our remaining <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, and our set of fingers appended with the open string played with no finger (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>):</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([{0, _possible_fingers} | chord], fingerings),
  do: choose_and_sieve(chord, [{0, nil} | fingerings])
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>In the case of actually needing to finger a note, the situation becomes more complicated. In that case, the next element of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is a fret and some set of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code>.</p>

<p>We’ll map over each of the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code>, appending each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">finger</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fret</span></code> to our list of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code>, sieving out any now-impossible <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingerings</span></code> from the remaining notes in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, and then recursively calling our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function with our newly sieved <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">new_fingerings</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([{fret, possible_fingers} | chord], fingerings),
  do:
    possible_fingers
    |&gt; Enum.map(fn finger -&gt;
      new_fingerings = [{fret, finger} | fingerings]

      chord
      |&gt; sieve_chord(new_fingerings)
      |&gt; choose_and_sieve(new_fingerings)
    end)
    |&gt; List.flatten()
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sieve_chord</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function maps over each of the notes in what’s left of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, and updates the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code> tuple element to sieve any fingerings that are now deemed impossible to play after placing our most recent finger:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp sieve_chord(chord, fingerings),
  do:
    chord
    |&gt; Enum.map(fn {fret, possible_fingers} -&gt;
      {fret, sieve_fingers(possible_fingers, fret, fingerings)}
    end)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sieve_fingers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> helper function is where we make real decisions about the behavior of our fingering algorithm. The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sieve_fingers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> function itself is fairly straight forward. It simply rejects and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code> that are considered “bad” by our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">bad_finger?</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> helper function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp sieve_fingers(possible_fingers, fret, fingerings),
  do: Enum.reject(possible_fingers, &amp;bad_finger?(fret, &amp;1, fingerings))
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">bad_finger?</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> function runs each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">finger</span></code>/<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fret</span></code> combinations through four rules used by our algorithm to determine if a finger choice is “impossible”, and should be culled from our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code> set:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp bad_finger?(fret, finger, fingerings),
  do:
    Enum.any?([
      fret_above_finger_below?(fret, finger, fingerings),
      fret_below_finger_above?(fret, finger, fingerings),
      same_finger?(fret, finger, fingerings),
      impossible_bar?(fret, finger, fingerings)
    ])
</code></pre>

<p>If any of those rules are violated, the finger is rejected.</p>

<p>The first two rules check if a possible finger would need to stretch over or under an already placed finger, respectively:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp fret_above_finger_below?(fret, finger, [{new_fret, new_finger} | _]),
  do: fret &gt; new_fret &amp;&amp; finger &lt; new_finger

defp fret_below_finger_above?(fret, finger, [{new_fret, new_finger} | _]),
  do: fret &lt; new_fret &amp;&amp; finger &gt; new_finger
</code></pre>

<p>The third rule verifies that no finger can be used twice, unless when performing a bar or double-stop over adjacent frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp same_finger?(fret, finger, [{new_fret, new_finger} | _]),
  do: finger == new_finger &amp;&amp; fret != new_fret
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we need to prevent “impossible bars”, or bars that would mute notes played on lower frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp impossible_bar?(_fret, finger, fingerings = [{new_fret, _} | _]),
  do:
    fingerings
    |&gt; Enum.filter(fn {fret, _finger} -&gt; fret &gt; new_fret end)
    |&gt; Enum.map(fn {_fret, finger} -&gt; finger end)
    |&gt; Enum.member?(finger)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve implemented our fingering algorithm, let’s try a few examples.</p>

<p>We’ll start by calculating the possible fingerings for the D minor chord we’ve been using as an example. Fingering suggestions are listed below each string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[nil, 5, 7, 7, 6, nil]
|&gt; Chord.Fingering.fingerings()
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;Chord.Renderer.to_string/1)
|&gt; Enum.join("\n\n")
|&gt; IO.puts
</code></pre>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/Dm-voicings.png" />
  <p>Fingerings for our D minor chord.</p>
</div>

<p>Awesome! The first suggested bar can be difficult to play, but with some practice doing <a href="http://forums.tedgreene.com/post/how-to-do-a-a-ted-greene-double-stop-8526262">Ted Greene-style double-stops</a>, it’s manageable. The second and third suggestions are what I would normally reach for.</p>

<p>Another interesting example is an open G major shape:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3]
|&gt; Chord.Fingering.fingerings()
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;Chord.Renderer.to_string/1)
|&gt; Enum.join("\n\n")
|&gt; IO.puts
</code></pre>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/G-voicings.png" />
  <p>Fingerings for our G chord.</p>
</div>

<p>The first few fingering suggestions make sense, but as we get closer to the end of the list, some of the suggestions are increasingly difficult to play. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to play this fingering:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/G-bad-voicing.png" />
  <p>An "impossible" to play fingering.</p>
</div>

<p>As a human, I can explain to you why this is difficult to play, but I haven’t been able to come up with a general rule to add to our rule set that would prevent these kinds of fingerings from being suggested. At this point, I’d rather have the algorithm present <em>potentially impossible</em> fingerings, than have it over-aggressively prune <em>possible</em> fingerings from the result set.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>In my previous article on <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">“Voice Leading with Elixir”</a>, I mentioned that I was conflating the ideas of “musical distance” and “physical distance”. In terms of voice leading, all I really care about is optimizing a chord progression for musical distance. But as a guitar player, I also want to consider “physical distance”.</p>

<p>If a set of chords all have the same “musical distance” from a given starting chord, I want to choose the chord that has the lowest “physical distance”. By “physical distance”, I mean literally fret distance, but also how difficult it is to transition from one chord to another. Do I just need to slide one finger? That’s easy! Do I need to lift and replace three fingers while sliding the fourth? That’s not so easy…</p>

<p>We can’t calculate the “physical distance” between chords unless we know the fingerings for the chords in question. Now that we know the potential fingerings for a given chord, we can compute a (modified) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">levenshtein distance</a> between the fingerings of two chords!</p>

<p>Why is that cool?</p>

<p>Once that’s done, we’ll be able to take a starting chord (optionally with a starting fingering), and find the best voicing of the landing chord in terms of voice leading and ease of playability!</p>

A few days ago, I wrote about two Rust pain points when using Rust at work. One of these points were the long compile times. In this post, I want to share a few tips that can help alleviate that pain.
Use cargo check We typically use the compiler for two reasons: to verify if the syntax and/or types are correct and to generate a runnable program. When compiling a program, especially a release build, the majority of the time is spent generating LLVM bytecode and optimizing that bytecode.</p>

<h4><a href="https://sgoel.org/posts/switching-from-keepassxc-to-bitwarden/">Switching from KeePassXC to Bitwarden</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I have been looking to replace my password management setup for a few months
now. Up until now I was using <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>, but I never got around to putting in
the work to make it work properly on mobile.</p>
<p>I understand that the standard solution is to just get the file synced on your
phone using Dropbox and then install a mobile app which can read the file off of
Dropbox. But the idea that all my passwords are in one single file somewhere on
the internet (cloud, if you will) is a bit disturbing.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is also the reason I never got around to using <a href="https://1password.com/">1password</a>,
<a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">Lastpass</a>, or other cloud-hosted password managers.</p>
<p>This is not to discount the work that the security folks at these companies are
putting in on a daily basis to make their services secure. And I know that my
passwords file is encrypted. I've just seen enough mistakes happen and I'd like
to avoid being a part of one.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>My requirements were fairly simple. I wanted something that</p>
<ol>
<li>is open-source</li>
<li>allows self-hosting</li>
<li>works on mobile</li>
</ol>
<p>... in that order.</p>
<p>Turns out that just these 3 requirements narrowed down the search to
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>.</p>
<h3>Bitwarden</h3>
<p>Bitwarden is <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden">open source</a>. There's a <code>core</code> server written in C# and then there
are multiple client apps (iOS, Android, desktop).</p>
<p>The backend appears quite heavy weight. Being written in C# and talking to a SQL
server installation, it's not exactly what I would call "deployment friendly".
Luckily, they provide a <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/core#deploy">Docker image</a> which you can use to self-host the whole
thing.</p>
<p>While this works on a modern machine, I wanted to run Bitwarden on a spare
Raspberry Pi connected to my home network where the system requirements are a
bit less than what the Docker image requires.</p>
<p>It turns out that I'm not the first person to run into this problem. <a href="https://jcs.org">@jcs</a>
already <a href="https://jcs.org/2017/11/17/bitwarden">wrote</a> a <a href="https://github.com/jcs/rubywarden">Ruby server</a> which is API-compatible with the "official"
Bitwarden backend. This implementation is <strong>very</strong> lightweight, and completely
doable for the Pi. So all I had to do was create a new <code>bitwarden</code> user on the
Pi, install <code>rvm</code>, <code>git clone</code> the repository, and then start the server
process.</p>
<p>The only problem left now was setting up a static IP for the Pi so that the
desktop client on my laptop and the iOS app on my phone know the
(static &amp; private) IP address they should be connecting to. Luckily my modem
supported allocating the same IP to devices based on their MAC addresses so this
was also easy.</p>
<h3>Migrating from KeePassXC</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jcs/rubywarden">rubywarden</a> includes a script to import existing KeePassXC database files, and
it worked without any problems. The script somehow didn't handle my KeePassXC
folders very well. So an entry called "Google" in the "Internet" folder was
imported as "Internet/Google". Those slashes look pretty annoying, so I took
some time out to delete some unused passwords and organize the rest into
folders.</p>
<p>Migration was a non-issue, I would say.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>The only caveat with this system that I can think of right now is that when
you're not at home, you won't be able to save/edit/delete passwords. You'll be
able to read just fine, but editing won't work.</p>
<p>The reason is that your client apps are configured to talk to a private IP
address (of the Pi in this case). But so far I haven't had the need to
save/edit/delete passwords when I'm outside. And reading them works just fine.</p>
<p>If this is important for you, then this is probably the price you pay for
keeping the passwords on a machine you can physically look at.</p>
<p>But overall, I find this setup quite nice to work with.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">Voice Leading with Elixir</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I play quite a bit of guitar in my free time. Once of the things I’ve been practicing lately is improving my voice leading between chords.</p>

<p>Voice leading refers to how the individual notes, or voices, within a chord move when you transition to another chord. You often want as little movement as possible to keep the transition from sounding jarring (unless you’re going for jarring).</p>

<p>So for example, if I play a G7 way up the neck, I probably wouldn’t want to follow it with a Cmaj7 played towards the nut. Instead, I’d like to find another voicing of Cmaj7 that’s both physically and musically closer to our G7 chord.</p>

<p>Knowing how to voice lead between chords usually requires a vast knowledge of the fretboard, a huge chord vocabulary, and lots of practice. But who needs all then when you have a computer and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">the Elixir programming language</a>?</p>

<p>Let’s use Elixir to chug through all of the possible Cmaj7 chords and find those with the best voice leading from our G7!</p>

<h2 id="rendering-chords">Rendering Chords</h2>

<p>Before we start talking about recruiting our computer to help us find the best voice leading between chords, we should take a detour and talk about guitar chords and how we’ll work with them.</p>

<p>When you break it down to the basic, a “guitar” is just six strings attached to a piece of wood. A “chord” is just a set of notes played simultaneously across any number of those strings. Different notes can be played on each string by pressing on any “fret” along the neck.</p>



<p>Given those definitions, the simplest ways to represent a chord using Elixir data structures probably be as a six element list (or tuple).</p>

<p>Here’s our G7 chord represented as an array:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil]
</code></pre>

<p>From the thickest string to the thinnest, we’re not playing anything on the first string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>). We’re playing a G on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">10</span></code>), a D on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">12</span></code>), an F on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">10</span></code>), a B on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">12</span></code>), and nothing on the thinnest string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>).</p>

<p>To make our lives easier, we should come up with some way of displaying these chords in a more guitarist-friendly manner. One common option for displaying guitar chords is with <a href="http://www.tedgreene.com/images/lessons/students/PaulVachon/HowToReadTedGreeneChordDiagrams.pdf">chord charts</a>:</p>

<p>To kick things off, let’s write a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Renderer</span></code> module with a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function that takes a chord and returns a unicode-based chart for the provided chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord.Renderer do
  def to_string(chord, chord_name) do
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we’ll need to do is find out the “reach” of our chord. What’s the lowest fret used in the chord and the highest?</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{min, max} =
  chord
  |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
  |&gt; Enum.min_max()
</code></pre>

<p>We can use Elixir’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reject</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> to filter out unplayed strings and then use <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">min_max</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> to easily find both the lowest and highest fret used in the chord.</p>

<p>Next we’ll iterate over every set of frets within the range of the chord and render each row using a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">row_to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> helper function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
0..max(max - min, 3)
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;row_to_string(&amp;1, min, chord, chord_name))
</code></pre>

<p>Most fret charts render some minimum number of rows, even if the chord only takes up one fret of vertical space. We’ll iterate between <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code> and either <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">max</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">min</span></code>, or <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">3</span></code>, depending on which value is larger. This means we’ll always render at least four rows of frets for each diagram.</p>

<p>We’ll also want to intersperse the horizontal fret lines below each row of fingered notes on each row of frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.intersperse([:bright, :black, "\n   ├┼┼┼┼┤\n"])
</code></pre>

<p>We’re using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.ANSI.html">Elixir’s ANSI color codes</a> to color our fretboard lines a dark grey color, and building our final string as <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/elixir-and-io-lists-part-1-building-output-efficiently/">an IO list</a>, rather than a single concatenated string.</p>

<p>Because we’re using ANSI color codes, we need to format and convert our resulting nested list structure into a string before returning it from our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; IO.ANSI.format()
|&gt; IO.chardata_to_string()
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">row_to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> helper function is fairly straight forward. It simply renders a left gutter, the row of frets with any potential fingerings, and a right gutter:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp row_to_string(offset, base, chord, chord_name),
  do: [
    left_gutter(offset, base + offset),
    Enum.map(chord, &amp;fret_to_string(&amp;1, base + offset)),
    right_gutter(offset, chord_name)
  ]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">left_gutter</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function renders the lowest fret used in the chord on the first line of the chart:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp left_gutter(0, fret),
    do: [:bright, :yellow, String.pad_leading("#{fret}", 2, " ") &lt;&gt; " "]
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, we render a spacer:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp left_gutter(_, _),
  do: "   "
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">right_gutter</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function either renders an optional <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_name</span></code> on the first line of the chord chart:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp right_gutter(0, chord_name),
  do: [:yellow, " #{chord_name}"]
</code></pre>

<p>Or an empty string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp right_gutter(_, _),
  do: ""
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all there is to it!</p>

<p>Now we can render chords by passing them into <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Renderer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.Renderer.to_string([nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil], "G7")
|&gt; IO.puts
</code></pre>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">10 │●│●││ G7
   ├┼┼┼┼┤
   ││││││
   ├┼┼┼┼┤
   ││●│●│
   ├┼┼┼┼┤
   ││││││
</code></pre>

<p>And in its fully colored glory:</p>

  <p>Our G7 chord, as rendered by our new module.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="chord-distance">Chord Distance</h2>

<p>We can roughly approximate how “good” the voice leading is between two chords by counting the number of frets each finger has to move when changing chords. We can call this the “distance” between the two chords. In the simplest terms, chords with good voice leading have minimal distance between each other.</p>

<p>If we can write a function that computes this distance between chords, we might be able to generate all possible Cmaj7 voicings, and find the voicing that leads best from our G7!</p>

<p>Let’s say that each fret moved on a single string equals one unit of “distance”, and adding or removing a note to or from a string also counts as a single unit of distance.</p>

<p>Using that heuristic, let’s write a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module and a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function that calculates the distance between two chords.</p>

<p>If both chords are equal, there is zero distance between them:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(chord, chord),
  do: 0
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the distance between two chords is the sum of the distance between their individual fretted notes on each string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance([fret_a | rest_a], [fret_b | rest_b]),
  do: distance(fret_a, fret_b) + distance(rest_a, rest_b)
</code></pre>

<p>If a the first chord doesn’t have a note fretted on a string, and the next chord does, we’ll add one unit of distance:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(nil, fret),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>And visa versa:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(fret, nil),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, if both strings have fretted notes, the distance moved on that string is the number of frets between the two chords on that string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(fret_a, fret_b),
  do: abs(fret_a - fret_b)
</code></pre>

<p>We can manually calculate the distance between our G7 chord (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">]</span></code>), and a few different Cmaj7 voicings we may know:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.distance([nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil], [nil, 3, 5, 4, 5, nil])   # 27
Chord.distance([nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil], [8, 10, 9, 9, nil, nil])  # 6
</code></pre>

<p>So according to our heuristic, the second voicing of Cmaj7 has much better voice leading between our G7 than the first voicing of Cmaj7.</p>

<p>This is great, but we’re still limited by our knowledge of the fretboard. What if we only know two voicings of a Cmaj7 chord. Is this the best we can do?</p>

<p>Absolutely not!</p>

<h2 id="brute-forced-voicings">Brute Forced Voicings</h2>

<p>The last piece of this puzzle is to write a function that will generate all possible voicings of a given chord across the neck of the guitar. If we have all of the possible voicings of our Cmaj7, for example, we can easily find the voicing that has the best voice leading from our G7 chord!</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def voicings(notes) do
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function accepts an array of numbers representing the notes we want in our chord. For example, if we wanted all of the voicings of our Cmaj7 chord, we’d call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">vocings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> with a C (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>), an E (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">4</span></code>), a G (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">7</span></code>), and a B (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">11</span></code>). These numbers correspond to the lowest set of <a href="http://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">MIDI notes</a>, ranging from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code> to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">11</span></code>.</p>

<p>The first thing we want to do is calculate all of the possible “note sets” that will be spread across our guitar strings:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
notes
|&gt; all_note_sets()
</code></pre>

<p>If a chord has fewer notes than the number of strings we want to play, some number of those notes will have to be repeated. To illustrate, imagine we want to play our four note Cmaj7 using all six strings of the guitar. We’ll obviously have four strings playing C, E, G, and B, but what will the other two strings play?</p>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">all_note_sets</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper functions calculates this list of all possible note sets using some hand-waving combinatorics, and a few unfortunate list comprehensions:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def all_note_sets(notes) do
  for length &lt;- 6..length(notes) do
    for base &lt;- Combination.combine(notes, min(length, length(notes))) do
      for extension &lt;- Combination.combine(notes, length - length(notes)) do
        base ++ extension
      end
    end
  end
  |&gt; Enum.reduce(&amp;Kernel.++/2)
  |&gt; Enum.reduce(&amp;Kernel.++/2)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Next, our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function needs to take each of these possible note sets and build all possible chords using that set of notes:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;build_chords/1)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">build_chords</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper works by recursively building up all possible chords made of all possible notes in the provided note sets.</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def build_chords(note_set, chord \\ [nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil], chords \\ [])
</code></pre>

<p>It starts by looking at the first note in the provided note set and finds all occurrences of that note across all of the strings of our guitar using the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">all_notes</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
note
|&gt; all_notes
</code></pre>

<p>Next, it filters out notes on strings already used in the current chord under construction:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.filter(fn {string, fret} -&gt; Enum.at(chord, string) == nil end)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, it takes each note, inserts it into the current chord, and checks the “stretch” of the chord. If the chord spans more than five frets, we deem it impossible to play and filter it out (which is obviously an over-simplification, especially at higher frets). Otherwise, we recursively call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">build_chords</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code>, passing in the newly updated current chord and the remaining set of notes in our note set:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(fn {string, fret} -&gt;
  new_chord = List.replace_at(chord, string, fret)

  {min, max} =
    new_chord
    |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
    |&gt; Enum.min_max(fn -&gt; {0, 0} end)

  if max - min &lt;= 5 do
    build_chords(rest, new_chord, chords)
  else
    chords
  end
end)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">all_notes</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper function works by accepting the abstract value of the note we’re looking for (C is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>), the optional <a href="http://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">MIDI notes</a> of the tuning of each string, and the optional number of frets up the neck we want to look for notes:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def all_notes(target_note, strings \\ [40, 45, 50, 55, 59, 64], frets \\ 12) do
end
</code></pre>

<p>It then constructs a two dimensional list of <a href="http://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">MIDI notes</a> up the neck and across the fretboard:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
fretboard =
  for fret &lt;- 0..frets,
    do: Enum.map(strings, &amp;(&amp;1 + fret))
</code></pre>

<p>Once we’ve built up our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fretboard</span></code>, we’ll filter out all of the notes that aren’t the specific note we’re looking for. We loop over every row of frets, and every string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
fretboard
|&gt; Enum.with_index()
|&gt; Enum.map(fn {row, index} -&gt;
  row
  |&gt; Enum.with_index()
  |&gt; Enum.map(fn {note, string} -&gt;
    ...
  end)
end)
</code></pre>

<p>For each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">note</span></code> we encounter, we check if <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">rem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">note</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">)</span></code> equals our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">target_note</span></code>. If it does, we replace the current note value with a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">string</span></code>/<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">index</span></code> tuple that can be used when building our guitar chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
if rem(note, 12) == target_note do
  {string, index}
else
  nil
end
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, we replace the current note with <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>.</p>

<p>Next, we flatten our multidimensional fretboard representation and filter out all of the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code> values, leaving us with just the set of notes we’re looking for, and where they can be found on the fretboard.</p>

<p>Cool!</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all Together</h2>

<p>Now that our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper is finished, we can put all of the pieces together.</p>

<p>Let’s start by calculating all of the possible voicings of our Cmaj7 chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[0, 4, 7, 11]
|&gt; Chord.voicings()
</code></pre>

<p>Next, let’s map over each voicing and build a tuple who’s first element is the distance from our G7 chord, and who’s second element is the generated voicing itself:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;{Chord.distance(&amp;1, [nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil]), &amp;1})
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s sort that list. Because the distance from our G7 chord is the first element in each tuple, we’re effectively sorting by distance:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.sort()
</code></pre>

<p>Now the “best” options for Cmaj7 voicings should be at the top of our list. Let’s take the first three:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.take(3)
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll map each voicing through our chord chart renderer:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(fn {distance, chord} -&gt; Chord.to_string(chord, "Cmaj7") end)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, let’s join each of our three charts together with newlines and print the result:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.join("\n\n")
|&gt; IO.puts()
</code></pre>



<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/voice-leading-with-elixir/Cmaj7+Voicings.png" />
  <p>Our generated Cmaj7 voicings.</p>
</div>

<p>Each of the voicings recommended by our software sound fairly nice. Much nicer than the first voicing we were using way down the neck. The third voicing definitely has an interesting flavor, and is something I never would have reached for without the help of this software, but I’m glad to know it’s there.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-and-future-work">Final Thoughts and Future Work</h2>

<p>I have many, many final thoughts about this project. If you can’t tell, I’m incredibly excited about this kind of thing.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on improving the “distance” heuristic, which raises many interesting questions about what exactly voice leading is, and who it’s for. Should I optimize for the player, or the listener? Thanks to how the guitar works, chords on wildly different sections of the neck may be very close musically, but my algorithm will filter these chords out as being “too far.” In many ways, I’m conflating “voice leading” between chords with “playability” between chords. Is this what I want?</p>

<p>I’m also working on optimizing the voice leading over entire chord progressions.  As you might guess, this is a much more expansive problem.</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/voice-leading-with-elixir/progression.png" />
  <p>A generated chord progression.</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, if you’re interested in this kind of thing, I highly recommend you check out Ted Greene’s guitar work. Ted is, in my opinion, one of the true masters of the guitar, and put some serious work into perfecting his voice leading skills.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.tedgreene.com/">Ted Greene archive</a>, the archive’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TedGreeneArchives">Youtube page</a>, and <strong>definitely check out two of Ted’s books: <a href="https://amzn.to/2uV6w1g">Chord Chemistry</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Chord-Progressions-Classical-Voicings/dp/0898986982/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1532731370&sr=1-1">Modern Chord Progressions</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve uploaded this entire project <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord">to Github</a>, if you’re curious the see the source in its entirety. Check it out!</p>

<p>Obviously, this kind of thing is just a tool, and the chord transitions and progressions generated by the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module are just suggestions and starting places, not fully-fleshed out music. That being said, these tools have already given me many new ideas and shown me many interesting chords I never would have reached for without having them shown to me.</p></p>

<h4><a href="https://sulami.github.io/How this blog is madeHow this blog is made">How this blog is made</a></h4>
<p>
<p>While this blog has always been powered by a static-page generator, a while ago I switched from using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, a Python-based generator, to <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, a Haskell-based one. There was no real practical reason for this, and objectively the switch has been a huge waste of time, though I have learned a lot about Haskell and am very happy with how this blog currently works.</p>
<p>The basic setup is quite simple, I am using <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> to manage build dependencies and sandboxing for Haskell<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is actually one of my basic requirements for new languages that I pick up. It is 2018, you can ship your language with a package manager that sandboxes by default. One of my biggest problems with Python is virtualenv.<br />
<br />
</span></span>. For reasons that become clear later in this post, I also need a LaTeX installation, which currently is not managed in any way, but I do not require anything out of the ordinary, so usually it is just a matter of install ing the distribution for my operating system.</p>
<h2 id="hakyll-hacks">Hakyll Hacks</h2>
<p>To achieve a nice, human-readable URL scheme I am not only generating a slug from the original file name, which usually matches the title, but to get rid of the ugly <code>.html</code> postfix I actually render all pages and posts to <code>index.html</code> files in directories with the corresponding name, resulting in URLs with trailing slashes. Credit for this goes to <a href="https://www.rohanjain.in/hakyll-clean-urls/">Rohan Jain</a>.</p>
<p>Of course this blog also has an Atom feed<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Atom vs. RSS has been <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/09/23/">debated for a while</a>, in the end my use case is super simple anyway, so I am just using Atom until I find an actually valid reason to get into comparing the two formats.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, so you can follow my posts in your favourite newsreader, or use Firefox live bookmarks for example. I ran into one particular problem with this though, as one of my recent posts included an ampersand (&amp;) in the title. The rendered feed file (no matter the format) would be invalid due to this. So I had to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">URL encoding</a> for titles myself (this is already done for the body by Hakyll). Thanks to the way Hakyll embraces the Haskell philosphy, this was just a matter of mapping the encoding function over the post titles for the feed output.</p>
<h2 id="symetric-html-pdf-output">Symetric HTML &amp; PDF output</h2>
<p>A long while ago I had the idea of making my CV available online in the browser, like many front end developers do to showcase their skills. At the same time I still need a PDF version that can be printed neatly. Being a developer, I of course cannot fathom the idea of having two sets of CVs, so I thought why not generate both versions from the same source (of truth), using one single build process. So that is what I am currently finalising.</p>
<p>The HTML version for the website is just a static page in the blog, simple enough. Hakyll gives me very fine-grained control over the actual build process, so I can leverage custom Markdown tags to control layout if I need to. The PDF version of my CV has always been generated using <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, because it generates beautifully rendered output in a reproducible fashion. Because I am using <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to generate HTML from the Markdown source, I am also using it to generate the LaTeX source code from the same source, and then just pass it into a LaTeX template. Then I just run <code>xetex</code> in a subprocess to render the final PDF.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>This blog is currently hosted in two locations, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> which I have been using for many years, and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/">GitLab pages</a>, which I only added recently. While the build and deployment process for these two platforms is slightly different, they mostly work off the same codebase, with the only difference being a <a href="https://github.com/sulami/sulami.github.io/blob/develop/Makefile">makefile for Github</a> being replaced by the <a href="https://gitlab.com/sulami/sulami.gitlab.io/blob/develop/.gitlab-ci.yml">GitLab-specific build file</a>. The Github version I generate locally with my locally compiled Hakyll, and then push the the right branch using the makefile. This makefile also allows me to run a local server to preview the rendered output before committing. The GitLab repository is setup to mirror the one on GitHub and rebuild via GitLab CI on every change, so it is compiling the Hakyll application in a Docker container and the generating the output.</p>
<p>These two build processes have different pros and cons. The GitHub version is available slightly faster, as my local render only takes a couple of seconds and after pushing I just have to wait for Github’s cache to refresh, which usually takes only a couple of minutes, while the GitLab version has to run the CI job which takes a couple of minutes. On the upside the GitLab version does not require me to have a locally installed version of Haskell, Stack or anything else, as long as I can push to the repository, allowing me to explore workflows which happen end-to-end on iOS. I have been investigating this exact workflow, using a combination of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737172">iA Writer</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334">Workflow</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807">Working Copy</a> to write, transform and push the posts, leaving the build process to GitLab CI.</p>

<p>One thing I wanted to think about is, speaking as someone working in this field and interested in making changes in my day-to-day life, what kind of tools or ideas would be useful for me? What should I do?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Alongside this thought, another thought I had is that somehow the big lists of rules feel very impersonal and disconnected from my experiences. I also feel a little bit unsatisfied about opt-in rules. Here’s a few from the around the place, that I’ve seen:</p>

<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
5 - Race Avoidance: Teams developing AI systems should actively cooperate to avoid corner-cutting on safety standards.
</div></li>
<li><div>
6 - Safety: AI systems should be safe and secure throughout their operational lifetime, and verifably so where applicable and feasible
</div></li>
<li><div>
7 - Failure Transparency: If an AI system causes harm, it should be possible to ascertain why.
</div></li>
<li><div>
8 - Judical Transparency: Any involvement by an autonomous system in judicial decision-making should provide a satisfactory explanation auditable by a competent human authority.
</div></li>
<li><div>
9 - Responsibility: Designers and building of advanced AI systems are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications.
</div></li>
<li><div>
10 - Value Alignment: Highly autonomous AI systems should be designed so that their goals and behviours
</div></li>
<li><div>
11 - Human Values: AI Systems should be designed and operated so as to be compatible with ideals of human dignift, rights, freedoms, and cultural diversity.
</div></li>
<li><div>
12 - Personal Privacy: People should have the right to access, manage and control the data they generate, given AI systems’ power to analyze and utilize that data.
</div></li>
<li><div>
13 - Liberty and Privacy: The application of AI to personal data must not unreasonably curtail people’s real or perceived liberty.
</div></li>
<li><div>
14 - Shared Benefit: AI technologies should benefit and empower as many people as possible.
</div></li>
<li><div>
15 - Shared Prosperity: The economic prosperity created by AI should be shared broadly, to benefit all of humanity.
</div></li>
<li><div>
16 - Human Control: Humans should choose how and whether to delegate decisions to AI systems, to accomplish human chose objectives.
</div></li>
<li><div>
17 - Non-subversion: The power conferred by control of highly advanced AI systems should respect and improve, rather an subvert, the social and civic processes on which the health of society depends.
</div></li>
<li><div>
18 - AI Arms Race: An arms race in lethal autonomous weapons should be avoided.

</div>
<div>
<p>I have a few problems with these rules:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
It’s easy to imagine situations in which they are counter-productive,
</div></li>
<li><div>
I don’t feel a lot of ownership of them, as I wasn’t involved in their construction,
</div></li>
<li><div>
No-one is enforcing them on me,
</div></li>
<li><div>
They’re often highly impractical or contain colloquial/regional/policital concerns (“Boost French Research …”),
</div></li>
<li><div>
They’re also very overwhelming and demanding, how can I ensure that we do <em>all</em> of them?
</div></li>
<li><div>
Even if I <em>say</em> I’m doing these things, how does any non-technical person know? How can I prove it?
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>The positive aspects of them are:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
It’s sometimes easy to think about how to apply them to day-to-day work,
</div></li>
<li><div>
They help me think of things that I might not care about day-to-day (i.e. the environmental concerns?),
</div></li>
<li><div>
It might help to lobby governments/organisations to get funding to make progress on certain aspects?
</div></li>
<li><div>
It provides a framework that might be useful for discussing with colleagues/other people
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, what should any given engineer working in this area do? One thought I’ve had recently is a simple one: Let’s just aim at building empathy for the people that will be affected by our software.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is reasonably actionable, say, with local groups by organising meetings between technical people and the people that may be affected. I.e. in the medical-AI setting, let’s organise regular catch-ups between the engineers, the doctors, nursing staff, and hospital adminstration types, along with perhaps patient representatives.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the setting, of, say, law software, again we just set up regular events for the two groups to chat through issues, work together on small projects, and build a mutual understanding of difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I think this approach is a bit nicer than, say, creating a new set of rules that make sense for us locally, and then forcing people to follow them. One idea I like about the empathy-based/collaborative approach (or “human-centered design”; another term for this kind thing), is that it allos people to <em>adapt to local circumstances</em>, which I think is really crucial in allowing any one person to feel like they have some control over the application of any rules they come up with, and thus getting them to actually take an interest in enforcing them in their organisation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, my new rule of thumb for this ethics-related AI stuff will be: Can I meet with some of the people that will be affected? What are their thoughts? What problems are they working through and what are they interested in?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As always, I’m interested in your thoughts on the matter!</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/23/building-a-better-receive-loop/">Building a Better Receive Loop</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I’ve been putting quite a bit of time this past week into overhauling and refactoring <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/bitcoin_network/">my in-progress Elixir-based Bitcoin node</a>.</p>

<p>As a part of that overhaul, I turned my attention to how we’re receiving packets from connected peers. The way we’ve been handling incoming packets is overly complicated and can be greatly simplified by taking advantage of the Bitcoin protocol’s packet structure.</p>

<p>Let’s go over our old solution and dig into how it can be improved.</p>

<h2 id="the-original-receive-loop">The Original Receive Loop</h2>

<p>Our Bitcoin node uses <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_tcp.html">Erlang’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span></code> module</a> to manage peer to peer communications. Originally, we were using <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span></code> in “active mode”, which means that incoming packets are delivered to our node’s Elixir process in the form of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:tcp</span></code> messages:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def handle_info({:tcp, _port, data}, state) do
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Because TCP is a streaming protocol, no guarantees can be made about the contents of these messages. A single message may contain a complete Bitcoin packet, a partial packet, multiple packets, or any combination of the above. To handle this ambiguity, the Bitcoin protocol deliminates each packet with a sequence of “magic bytes”. Once we reach this magic sequence, we know that everything we’ve received up until that point constitutes a single packet.</p>

<p>My previous receive loop worked by maintaining a backlog of all incoming bytes up until the most recently received sequence of magic bytes. Every time a new message was received, it would append those incoming bytes to the backlog and chunk that binary into a sequence of packets, which could then be handled individually:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{messages, rest} = chunk(state.rest &lt;&gt; data)

case handle_messages(messages, state) do
  {:error, reason, state} -&gt; {:disconnect, reason, %{state | rest: rest}}
  state -&gt; {:noreply, %{state | rest: rest}}
end
</code></pre>

<p>This solution works, but there are quite a few moving pieces. Not only do we have to maintain a backlog of all recently received bytes, we also have to build out the functionality to split that stream of bytes into individual packets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp chunk(binary, messages \\ []) do
  case Message.parse(binary) do
    {:ok, message, rest} -&gt;
      chunk(rest, messages ++ [message])

    nil -&gt;
      {messages, binary}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Thankfully, there’s a better way.</p>

<h2 id="taking-advantage-of-payload-length">Taking Advantage of Payload Length</h2>

<p>Every message sent through the Bitcoin protocol <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Message_structure">follows a specific format</a>.</p>

<p>The first four bytes of every packet are reserved for the network’s magic bytes. Next, twelve bytes are reserved for the name of the command being sent across the network. The next four bytes hold the length of the payload being sent, followed by a four byte partial checksum of that payload.</p>

        </form>
    </div>
</div>

<p>These twenty four bytes can be found at the head of every message sent across the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network, followed by the variable length binary payload representing the meat and potatoes of the command being carried out. Relying on this structure can greatly simplify our receive loop.</p>

<p>By using <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span></code> in “passive mode” (setting <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">active:</span> <span class="no">false</span></code>), incoming TCP packets won’t be delivered to our current process as messages. Instead, we can ask for packets using a blocking call to <a href="http://erlang.org/doc/man/gen_tcp.html#recv-2"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">recv</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code></a>. When requesting packets, we can even specify the number of bytes we want to receive from the incoming TCP stream.</p>

<p>Instead of receiving partial messages of unknown size, we can ask <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span></code> for the next <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">24</span></code> bytes in the stream:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{:ok, message} &lt;- :gen_tcp.recv(socket, 24)
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we can parse the received <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">message</span></code> bytes and request the payload’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">size</span></code> in bytes from our socket:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{:ok, %{size: size}} &lt;- Message.parse(message),
{:ok, payload} &lt;- :gen_tcp.recv(socket, size)
</code></pre>

<p>And now we can parse and handle our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">payload</span></code>, knowing that it’s guaranteed to be a single, complete Bitcoin command sent across the peer-to-peer network.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>There’s more than goes into the solution that I outlined above. For example, if we’re receiving a command like <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="sd">"</span><span class="s2">verack"</span></code>, which has a zero byte payload, asking for zero bytes from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">recv</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> will actually return all of the available bytes it has in its TCP stream.</p>

<p>Complications included, I still think this new solution is superior to our old solution of maintaining and continually chunking an ongoing stream of bytes pulled off the network.</p>

<p>If you’re eager to see the full details of the new receive loop, <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/bitcoin_network/blob/master/lib/bitcoin_network/peer/connection.ex#L80-L98">check it out on Github</a>!</p>

<p>I’d also like to thank <a href="https://github.com/karlseguin">Karl Seguin</a> for inspiring me to improve our Bitcoin node using this technique. He posted a message on <a href="https://elixir-slackin.herokuapp.com/">the Elixir Slack group</a> about prefixing TCP messages with their length to easily determine how many bytes to receive:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’d length prefix every message with 4 bytes and do two recvs, 
<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:ok</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">&lt;&lt;</span><span class="n">length</span><span class="p">::</span><span class="n">big</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="m">32</span><span class="o">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">recv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">socket</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">TIMEOUT</span><span class="p">)</span></code>
<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">{</span><span class="ss">:ok</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">message</span><span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">recv</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">socket</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">length</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">TIMEOUT</span><span class="p">)</span></code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This one line comment opened my mind to the realization that the Bitcoin protocol was already doing this, and that I was overcomplicating the process of receiving messages.</p>

<p>Thanks Karl!</p></p>

<p>While I've grown used to specifying
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0.0.0.0">0.0.0.0</a> as the listening address for

<p>If the listening address of a server ever needs to be communicated to others
(as is the case with clustered systems), configuring <code>0.0.0.0</code> will lead to bad
things happening. That is: other servers, having learned that your address is
<code>0.0.0.0:SOMEPORT</code>, will attempt to connect and fail.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122">RFC</a> states clearly:</p>

<blockquote><p>This host on this network.  MUST NOT be sent, except as
a source address as part of an initializatioan procedure

<h4><a href="https://www.anishathalye.com/2018/07/19/gemini-a-modern-beamerposter-theme/">Gemini: A Modern LaTeX Poster Theme</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Programs like PowerPoint, Keynote, and Adobe Illustrator are common tools for
designing posters, but these programs have a number of disadvantages, including
lack of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_content_and_presentation">separation of content and presentation</a> and lack of
programmatic control over the output. Designing posters using these programs
can require countless hours calculating positions of elements by hand, manually
laying out content, manually propagating style changes, and repeating these
kinds of tasks over and over again during the iterative process of poster
design.</p>

<p>The idea of using a document preparation system like <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> to implement a
poster using code sounds fantastic, and indeed, there are a number of LaTeX
<a href="https://www.latextemplates.com/cat/conference-posters">templates</a> and packages for making posters, such as <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/a0poster">a0poster</a>, <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/sciposter">sciposter</a>,
and <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/beamerposter">beamerposter</a>. However, I didn’t like the look of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=latex+poster+template&tbm=isch">existing</a> themes
and templates — they all looked 20 years old — and this is what kept me
from using LaTeX for making posters, even though I had been using the software
for years for authoring documents.</p>

<p>I finally bit the bullet and spent some time designing a clean, stylish, and
minimal poster theme for LaTeX, building on top of the beamerposter package.
The result has been open-sourced as <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini">Gemini</a>, and it makes it really easy to
design posters that look like this:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster.pdf"><img src="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster.png" alt="Poster example" /></a></p>

<h1 id="why-latex">Why LaTeX?</h1>

<p>There are a number of programs commonly used for making academic posters. These
include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Word processing programs (e.g. Word, Pages, and LibreOffice Writer)</li>
  <li>Presentation programs (e.g. PowerPoint, Keynote, and LibreOffice Impress)</li>
  <li>Vector editing programs (e.g. Adobe Illustrator and Inkscape)</li>
</ul>

<p>Why use LaTex over these programs? The biggest benefit is that LaTeX does not
require manual effort to lay out contents and apply a uniform style to the
entire poster. All layout and styling is done using code relying on TeX’s
sophisticated layout algorithms, and there is a clean separation of content and
presentation, similar to the content/style separation in HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>There are other benefits as well. TeX is a sophisticated typesetting system
that produces excellent results for text as well as mathematical formulae;
LaTeX packages provide support for <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/pgfplots?lang=en">plotting</a> and algorithmically
specified <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/pgf">diagrams and vector graphics</a>; and beamer provides support for
column-based layout, including variable-width and nested columns. This means
that all content in the poster, not just the text, can be produced using code:
no more screenshots of mathematical equations; no more positioning shapes with
the mouse to create diagrams; no more screenshots of plots where the styling
doesn’t quite match the style of the poster; and no more manual positioning of
blocks.</p>

<h1 id="a-modern-latex-poster-theme">A modern LaTeX poster theme</h1>

<p>Building posters with LaTeX is by far a better experience than using
PowerPoint, Keynote, or Illustrator. I felt that the one thing missing was an
aesthetically pleasing poster theme. There’s no reason a poster designed using
LaTeX should look any less beautiful than a poster made using graphic design
software like Adobe Illustrator.</p>

<p>This is what led to the creation of <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini">Gemini</a>, a LaTex poster theme with a focus
on being clean, minimal, and looking great out of the box while being
customizable:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster-gemini.pdf"><img src="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster-gemini.png" alt="Gemini default theme example" /></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster-mit.pdf"><img src="https://www.anishathalye.com/media/2018/07/19/poster-mit.png" alt="MIT theme example" /></a></p>

<p>The theme is actually a pretty small amount of code; most of the functionality
is provided by LaTeX and beamerposter. But making conscious choices on title
and block layout, font families, font weights, color schemes, and other little
details makes a pretty big difference in how the poster looks and feels.</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://jakob.spaceReplacing+Anki+With+org-drill">Replacing Anki With org-drill</a></h4>
<p>
<p class="indent">Recently, I read Michael Nielsen's essay, <a href="http://augmentingcognition.com/ltm.html">"Augmenting Cognition"</a>. It talks
about some very interesting use cases for the spaced repetition software "Anki"
that made me want to try it out again. I'm familiar with Anki, as I used it
extensively throughout my last year of high school to study for AP exams. At the
time, Anki's "killer feature" for me over similar software was being able to
typeset mathematical notation in LaTeX (the exams were Chemistry and Calculus,
so almost all of the material to memorize was mathematical notation). It's a
great piece of software; I've been using it with the brother I'm helping through
summer school. But ever since I began using Gentoo, I've been trying to avoid
packages like QtWebView, which has deterred me from installing Anki on my
machine. With a little bit of searching, however, I found that there was an
Emacs package for spaced repetition named 'org-drill', so I decided to check it
out.</p>
<p class="indent">org-drill is included in org by default (which happens to be included in Emacs
by default), but it does need to be enabled. The steps to do so are outlined on
the corresponding <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-drill.html">worg page</a>. So far, I've used it to study German
vocabulary and the material for my ham radio license exams, and I'm very happy
with it. It has all of the features you might want from Anki, like Cloze
deletion and double-sided cards, but I find that card creation is even more
intuitive in org markup. Clozes are as simple as enclosing the answers in square
brackets, and multi-sided cards just entail making multiple headings and setting
the ":DRILL_CARD_TYPE:". You can even write your own card types in elisp.
Another benefit of using org markup as the source for cards is that I can easily
transform a plain text file into a deck using emacs macros.</p>
<p class="indent">Unlike Anki, however, org-drill has support for the SM5 and SM8 scheduling
algorithms. <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html#what-algorithm">Anki is quite outspoken about the benefits of SM2 over the later
renditions,</a> but I appreciate that I at least have the option to use these
schedulers if I want to. The algorithms' parameters can also be finely tuned;
the one I've found most useful is 'org-drill-learn-fraction', which I can use to
decrease the amount of time before I see a card again.</p>
<p class="indent">As I mentioned earlier, the feature that brought me to Anki was its support for
typesetting math with LaTeX. Emacs certainly has support for rendering LaTeX,
but I have a pretty wonky setup where I'm running Emacs in a terminal emulator,
so what I opted for instead was a typesetting language that renders to unicode
text. There are quite a few of these, but the one I was most impressed with is
<a href="https://arthursonzogni.com/Diagon/">Diagon</a>. It's meant to be run in the browser, but the backend is written in
C++ and can be compiled to run natively. Be warned, however, that the build
system does require Java.</p>
<p class="indent">First, I replace 'src/main.cpp' with the following. The version in VCS will
unconditionally run the SequenceTranslator, but this modification enables us to
select which translator to use from a command-line argument.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cpp">#include &quot;translator/Translator.h&quot;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;

int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
    if (argc != 2) {
        std::cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;usage: &quot; &lt;&lt; argv[0] &lt;&lt; &quot; [translator]&quot; &lt;&lt; std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    std::string input;
    for (std::string line; std::getline(std::cin, line);) {
        input += line + &quot;\n&quot;;
    }

    auto translator = TranslatorFromName(argv[1]);
    std::cout &lt;&lt; (*translator)(input, &quot;&quot;) &lt;&lt; std::endl;

    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Then, compiling is as easy as</p>
<pre><code class="lang-sh">cd tools/antlr/
./download_and_patch.sh
cd ../../
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
</code></pre>
<p>And for Emacs integration, I've added the following to my '.emacs'</p>
<pre><code class="lang-elisp">;; Applies Diagon's &quot;Math&quot; formatter to the current region, replacing
;; the contents of the region with the formatted output.
(defun format-math-at-region ()
  (interactive)
  (let* ((math-to-format (buffer-substring (region-beginning) (region-end)))
         (command (format &quot;echo \&quot;%s\&quot; | diagon Math&quot; math-to-format))) ;; Bad and hacky. I'm aware.
      (kill-region (region-beginning) (region-end))
      (insert (string-trim-right (shell-command-to-string command)))))
</code></pre>
<p>It's not as powerful as LaTeX, but it certainly suits my needs.</p>

<h4><a href="http://caiustheory.com/running-rails-tests-under-circleci-2.0-with-mariadb/">Running rails tests under CircleCI 2.0 with MariaDB</a></h4>
<p>
<p><a href="https://circleci.com">CircleCI</a> have released their version 2.0 platform, which is based on top of docker and moves the configuration for each project into a config file in the git repository.</p>

<p>They have a bunch of documentation at <a href="https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/">https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/</a>. Basic gist is the config file lives at <code>.circleci/config.yml</code> and defines which images to run a series of commands in. You can either specify jobs to run in series, or a workflow containing jobs which can depend on each other and/or run in parallel.</p>

<p>The first step is finding a base image that contains ruby, node and chrome/chromedriver so the the app runs, assets compile and rails feature specs work respectively.</p>

<p>The available images for ruby are listed at <a href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/ruby/images">https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/ruby/images</a>, and the mariadb images are listed at <a href="https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/mariadb/images">https://github.com/CircleCI-Public/circleci-dockerfiles/tree/master/mariadb/images</a>. For the ruby images you'll want to use the <code>…-node-browsers</code> image as it has Node.js for assets and Chrome/chromedriver installed for headless browser testing.</p>

<p>So the start of our config file looks something like the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml">version<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w"></span>working_directory<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"~/project"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w"></span>docker<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>image<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"circleci/ruby:2.4.1-node-browsers"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">    </span>environment<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>RAILS_ENV<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"test"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>image<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"mariadb:10.2.12"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">    </span>environment<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>MYSQL_DATABASE<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"app_test"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>MYSQL_USER<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"root"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>MYSQL_ALLOW_EMPTY_PASSWORD<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>MYSQL_HOST<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"localhost"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Once we have that then we can start on setting up our rails environment to the point we can run tests. First of all we need to install all our ruby dependencies via <a href="https://bundler.io">bundler</a>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml">jobs<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> 
</span><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Install ruby dependencies"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bundle install --path vendor/bundle"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we need to install our JS dependencies via <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/">yarn</a>, in much the same way as we did for the ruby dependencies.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Install js dependencies"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"yarn install"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then we need to sort out our database. There's a chance that the docker instance for MariaDB hasn't come up yet, so we can lean on a tool called <code>dockerize</code> to wait for it to be available. Then we can ask rails to go ahead and setup our test database.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Wait for database to be available"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"dockerize -wait tcp://127.0.0.1:3306 -timeout 1m"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Setup database"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bundle exec rake db:setup"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And then finally we can run our tests as the final step.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml"><span class="w">  </span>-<span class="w"> </span>run<span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>name<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"Run tests"</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">      </span>command<span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"bundle exec rspec"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Putting it all together, we have the following in <code>.circleci/config.yml</code>:</p>

<h4><a href="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/2018-07-10-mitogen-released.html">Mitogen released!</a></h4>
<p>
<img src="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/images/mito1/cell_division.png" />

    <p>
    After 4 months development, a design phase stretching back 10 years and
    more than 1,300 commits, I am pleased to finally announce the first stable
    series of Mitogen and the Mitogen for Ansible extension.
    </p>

    <p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/">Mitogen is a Python zero-deploy
    distributed programming library</a> designed to drastically increase the
    functional capability of infrastructure software operating via SSH. <a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ansible.html">Mitogen for
    Ansible</a> is a drop-in replacement for Ansible's lower tiers, netting
    huge speed and efficiency improvements for common playbooks.
    </p>

    <p><strong>What's There</strong></p>

    <p>
    This initial series covers a widely compatible drop-in Ansible extension on
    Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.6, a preview of the first value-added functionality
    for Ansible (<a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ansible.html#connection-delegation">Connection
    Delegation</a>), and a freeze of the underlying library required to support
    it.
    </p>

    <p>
    With the exception of some gotchas listed in the <a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/changelog.html">release
    notes</a>, you should expect the Ansible extension to <em>just work</em>,
    and if it doesn't <a target="_blank" href="https://goo.gl/yLKZiJ">please let me know via
    GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Demo</strong></p>

    <p>
    Refer to the posts under <em>Just Tuning In?</em> below for a 1000 foot
    view of the direction this work is heading, but for an idea of how things
    are today, watch the first minute of this recording, demonstrating a
    loop-heavy configuration of Mitogen's tests executing against the local
    machine.
    </p>

    <p>
    
        
    
    </p>

    <p><strong>Installation</strong></p>

    <p>
    To install Mitogen for Ansible, just follow the <strong><a target="_blank" href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ansible.html#installation">5
    easy steps</a></strong> in the documentation. For non-Ansible users the
    library is available from PyPI via <code>pip install mitogen</code>.
    Introductory documentation for the library is very weak right now, it will
    improve over the course of the stable series.
    </p>

    <!--
    <p><strong>Early User Feedback</strong></p>

    <ul>
    <li>"With mitogen <strong>my playbook runtime went from 45 minutes to just
        under 3 minutes</strong>. Awesome work!"</li>
    <li>"The runtime was reduced from <strong>1.5 hours on 4 servers to just
        under 3 minutes</strong>. Thanks!"</li>
    <li>"Oh, performance improvement using Mitogen is <strong>huge</strong>. As
        mentioned before, running with Mitogen enables takes 7m36 (give or take
        a few seconds). Without Mitogen, the same run takes 19m49! <strong>I'm not
        even deploying without Mitogen anymore</strong> :)"</li>
    <li>"<strong>Works like a charm</strong>, thank you for your quick response"</li>
    <li>"I tried it out. <strong>He is not kidding about the speed
        increase</strong>."
    <li>"I don't know what kind of dark magic @dmw_83 has done, but his Mitogen
        strategy took Clojars' Ansible runs from <strong>14 minutes to 2
        minutes</strong>. I still can't quite believe it."</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>What's next</strong></p>

    <p>
    Feature work will resume after most issues are ironed out of the stable
    series -- in particular I'm expecting more bugs around Python 3 and cross
    2/3 interoperability. Once 0.2.x looks solid, one important goal is a
    complete and widely compatible Connection Delegation feature, including a
    rewrite of the <code>fakessh</code> component to support transparent use of
    the <code>synchronize</code> module.

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/09/golfing-for-fizzbuzz-in-clojure-and-elixir/">Golfing for FizzBuzz in Clojure and Elixir</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I recently came across <a href="https://gist.github.com/krisajenkins/3333741">this riff on the FizzBuzz problem written in Clojure</a>. While it’s admittedly not terribly obvious what’s going on, I thought it was a novel solution to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz">the FizzBuzz problem</a>.</p>

<p>How could we recreate this solution using <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a>? There are some obvious similarities between Clojure’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">cycle</span></code> and <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#cycle/1">Elixir’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cycle</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code></a>. As someone who’s always been a fanboy of Lisp syntax, which solution would I prefer?</p>

<p>There’s only one way to find out…</p>

<h2 id="but-first-an-explanation">But First, an Explanation</h2>

<p>Before we dive into our Elixir solution, we should work out what exactly this Clojure solution is doing:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
(clojure.pprint/pprint
  (map vector
    (range 25)
    (cycle [:fizz :_ :_])
    (cycle [:buzz :_ :_ :_ :_])))
</code></pre>

<p>Clojure’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">clojure</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">pprint</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">pprint</span></code> obviously just prints whatever’s passed into it. In this case, we’re printing the result of this expression:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
(map vector
  (range 25)
  (cycle [:fizz :_ :_])
  (cycle [:buzz :_ :_ :_ :_])))
</code></pre>

<p>But what exactly’s happening here? Clojure’s <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/map"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">map</span></code></a> function is interesting. It let’s you map a function over any number of collections. The result of the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">map</span></code>  expression is the result of applying the function to each of the first values of each collection, followed by the result of applying the mapped function to each of the second values, and so on.</p>

<p>In this case, we’re mapping the <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/vector"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">vector</span></code></a> function over three collections: the range of numbers from zero to twenty four (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">range</span> <span class="m">25</span><span class="p">)</span></code>), <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/cycle">the infinite cycle</a> of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:fizz</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code>, and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code> (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cycle</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:fizz</span> <span class="ss">:_</span> <span class="ss">:_</span><span class="p">])</span></code>), and the infinite cycle of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:buzz</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:_</span></code> (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">cycle</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="ss">:buzz</span> <span class="ss">:_</span> <span class="ss">:_</span> <span class="ss">:_</span> <span class="ss">:_</span><span class="p">])</span></code>).</p>

<p>Mapping <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">vector</span></code> over each of these collections creates a vector for each index, and whether it should display Fizz, Buzz, or FizzBuzz for that particular index.</p>

<p>The result looks just like we’d expect:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
([0 :fizz :buzz]
 [1 :_ :_]
 [2 :_ :_]
 [3 :fizz :_]
 [4 :_ :_]
 [5 :_ :buzz]
 ...
 [24 :fizz :_])
</code></pre>

<h2 id="an-elixir-solution">An Elixir Solution</h2>

<p>So how would we implement this style of FizzBuzz solution using Elixir? As we mentioned earlier, Elixir’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">cycle</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function is almost identical to Clojure’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">cycle</span></code>. Let’s start there.</p>

<p>We’ll make two cycles of our Fizz and Buzz sequences:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Stream.cycle([:fizz, :_, :_])
Stream.cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_])
</code></pre>

<p>On their own, these two cycles don’t do much.</p>

<p>Let’s use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#zip/2"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zip</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code></a> to effectively perform the same operation as Clojure’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">map</span> <span class="n">vector</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Stream.zip(Stream.cycle([:fizz, :_, :_]), Stream.cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_])) 
</code></pre>

<p>Now we can print the first twenty five pairs by piping our zipped streams into <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">take</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> and printing the result with <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">IO</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">inspect</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Stream.zip(Stream.cycle([:fizz, :_, :_]), Stream.cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_])) 
|&gt; Enum.take(25)
|&gt; IO.inspect
</code></pre>

<p>Our result looks similar:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[
  fizz: :buzz,
  _: :_,
  _: :_,
  fizz: :_,
  _: :_,
  _: :buzz,
  ...
  fizz: :_
]
</code></pre>

<p>While our solution works, I’m not completely happy with it.</p>

<h2 id="polishing-our-solution">Polishing Our Solution</h2>

<p>For purely aesthetic reasons, let’s import the function’s we’re using from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">IO</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
import Stream, only: [cycle: 1, zip: 2]
import Enum, only: [take: 2]
import IO, only: [inspect: 1]
</code></pre>

<p>This simplifies the visual complexity of our solution:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
zip(cycle([:fizz, :_, :_]), cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_]))
|&gt; take(25)
|&gt; inspect
</code></pre>

<p>But we can take it one step further.</p>

<p>Rather than using <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zip</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>, which expects a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">left</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">right</span></code> argument, let’s use <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Stream.html#zip/1"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Stream</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">zip</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code></a>, which expects to be passed an enumerable of streams:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[
  cycle([:fizz, :_, :_]),
  cycle([:buzz, :_, :_, :_, :_])
]
|&gt; zip
|&gt; take(25)
|&gt; inspect
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s our final solution.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>To be honest, I’ve been having troubles lately coming to terms with some of Elixir’s aesthetic choices. As someone who’s always admired the simplicity of Lisp syntax, I fully expected myself to prefer the Clojure solution over the Elixir solution.</p>

<p>That being said, I hugely prefer the Elixir solution we came up with!</p>

<p>The overall attack plan of the algorithm is much more apparent. It’s immediately clear that we start with two cycles of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:fizz</span></code>/<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:buzz</span></code> and some number of empty atoms. From there, we zip together the streams and take the first twenty five results. Lastly, we inspect the result.</p>

<p>Which solution do you prefer?</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/09/ping-pong-and-unresponsive-bitcoin-nodes/">Ping, Pong, and Unresponsive Bitcoin Nodes</a></h4>
<p>
<p>The last piece of low-hanging fruit required to finish up the connectivity of our in-progress, <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir-powered</a> Bitcoin node is to implement a system to detect unresponsive peer connections and prune them from our list of active peers.</p>

<p>Once an inactive peer is removed, our current system will automatically connect to a new peer to take its place.</p>

<p>There are several potential solutions for building out this kind of timeout system, and I’ve been weighing their pros and cons in the back of my mind for several weeks. I think I’ve come to a relatively simple and elegant solution that tackles the problem with minimal technical and mental overhead.</p>

<p>Let’s dive in!</p>

<h2 id="who-cares-about-unresponsive-nodes">Who Cares About Unresponsive Nodes?</h2>

<p>In its current state, our Bitcoin node will connect to <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/23e7fe8be827cdcdcace2a77ecc683074b97f8a2/src/net.h#L70-L71">up to one hundred twenty five peer nodes</a>. We assume that each of these nodes is a fully functioning and active part of the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network. If we don’t receive any messages from them, or if messages dwindle over time, we just assume that the network doesn’t have much to tell us.</p>

<p>This assumption can lead to trouble. If we continue to persist our connections to unresponsive nodes, it’s conceivable that eventually every node we’re connected to will become unresponsive for some reason or another.</p>

<p>At that point, our Bitcoin node is dead in the water. It’s unable to send or receive any information, and it’s unable to fetch any additional peers to reestablish its place in the peer-to-peer network. At this point our only course of action would be to restart the node and try again.</p>

<p>And that’s not a very robust solution…</p>

<h2 id="detecting-slow-connections">Detecting Slow Connections</h2>

<p>Instead, we should be proactive about pruning unresponsive nodes from our set of peers. The first piece of low hanging fruit was can go after is adding a timeout to our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:gen_tcp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> call:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
:gen_tcp.connect(
  IP.to_tuple(state.ip),
  state.port,
  options,
  Application.get_env(:bitcoin_network, :timeout)
)
</code></pre>

<p>If a node takes too long to respond to our initial connection request (in this case, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code> is set to thirty seconds), we’ll retry the connection a few times and then ultimately remove the node from our set of peers.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-unresponsive-nodes">Detecting Unresponsive Nodes</h2>

<p>The next step in aggressively pruning our peer list is to watch for unresponsive nodes. We’ll do this by setting up a timeout between every message we receive from our peer. If we don’t receive another message before a certain cutoff time, we deem the peer unresponsive and break our connection.</p>

<p>We’ll start by adding a call to a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">refresh_timeout</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper function in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:tcp</span></code> info handler:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def handle_info({:tcp, _port, data}, state) do
  state = refresh_timeout(state)
  ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first time <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">refresh_timeout</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> is called, it schedules a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code> message to be sent to the current process after a certain amount of time. A reference to that timer is stored in the process’ current state:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp refresh_timeout(state) do
  timer = Process.send_after(self(), :timeout, Application.get_env(:bitcoin_network, :timeout))
  Map.put_new(state, :timer, timer)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Subsequent calls to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">refresh_timeout</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> cancel the existing timer, and create a new one:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp refresh_timeout(state = %{timer: timer}) do
  Process.cancel_timer(timer)
  refresh_timeout(Map.delete(state, :timer))
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now we need to add a callback to handle the scheduled <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code> message:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def handle_info(:timeout, state) do
  {:disconnect, :timeout, state}
end
</code></pre>

<p>Whenever we receive a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code> message, we simply kill the current process, effectively disconnecting the associated peer.</p>

<h2 id="ensuring-a-constant-stream-of-messages">Ensuring A Constant Stream of Messages</h2>

<p>So now we’re disconnecting peers if we don’t receive a message from them within a certain period of time (thirty seconds in my case), but we have no way of guaranteeing that we <em>should</em> receive messages this frequently. What if there are no new blocks or transactions on the network?</p>

<p>To guarantee what we receive regular periodic messages, we need to set up a ping/pong loop.</p>

</div>

<p>Every so often we’ll send our peer node a “ping” message. If they’re still responsive, they’ll immediately respond with a “pong”. The peer will ensure our responsiveness by sending their own “pings”, which we’re already responding to.</p>

<p>According to the woefully under-documented Bitcoin protocol, we can’t send our first “ping” until we send back our “verack” message. Any messages sent prior to our “verack” will mark our node as “misbehaving” and risk a disconnection.</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp handle_payload(%Version{}, state) do
  with :ok &lt;- Message.serialize("verack") |&gt; send_message(state.socket),
       :ok &lt;- Message.serialize("getaddr") |&gt; send_message(state.socket),
       :ok &lt;-
         Message.serialize("ping", %Ping{
           nonce: :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(8)
         })
         |&gt; send_message(state.socket) do
    {:ok, state}
  else
    {:error, reason} -&gt; {:error, reason, state}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now that we’ve sent our “ping”, we can expect to receive a “pong” in reply. When we receive the peer’s “pong” response, we want to schedule another “ping” to be sent a short time in the future. We do this by scheduling a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:send_ping</span></code> message to be sent to the current process after a short interval:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp handle_payload(%Pong{}, state) do
  Process.send_after(self(), :send_ping, Application.get_env(:bitcoin_network, :ping_time))
  {:ok, state}
end
</code></pre>

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:send_ping</span></code> handler sends another “ping” message, completing the ping/pong cycle:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def handle_info(:send_ping, state) do
  with :ok &lt;-
         Message.serialize("ping", %Ping{
           nonce: :crypto.strong_rand_bytes(8)
         })
         |&gt; send_message(state.socket) do
    {:noreply, state}
  else
    {:error, reason} -&gt; {:error, reason, state}
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s all there is to it!</p>

<p>As long as <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:ping_time</span></code> is reasonably less than our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:timeout</span></code>, we should always have a constant stream of “ping” messages to keep our timeout timer from firing. If one of our peers ever fails to send their “pong”, we kill their corresponding <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Node</span></code> process.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As far as I’m concerned, that wraps up the networking portion of our in-progress Elixir-based Bitcoin node project. In the future we’ll turn our attention to the actual guts of a Bitcoin node: processing blocks and transactions.</p>

<p>At some point we might also slap a fancy user interface on top of our node. Everything’s better with a great UI.</p>

<p>Stay tuned!</p></p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/02/making-noise-with-j/">Making Noise with J</a></h4>
<p>
<p>I’ve always been fascinated by live-coded music. Frameworks like <a href="http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/">Chuck</a>, <a href="https://supercollider.github.io/">Supercollider</a>, <a href="http://overtone.github.io/">Overtone</a>, <a href="https://extemporelang.github.io/">Extempore</a>, and <a href="https://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic PI</a>, along with popular performers and musicians like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJPdbp1An2s">Sam Aaron</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSGKEy8vHqg">Andrew Sorensen</a> have never ceased to amaze and inspire me.</p>

<p>That said, whenever I’ve tried to use one of those tools or frameworks to create my own music, I’ve always quickly given up. Maybe it’s because I’m just lazy and learning new things is hard, but I’ve always told myself that it’s because the tools I was using <em>just didn’t fit</em> with how I felt programming music should be. Syntactically, ergonomically, and conceptually, the tools just didn’t jive.</p>

<p>And then I stumbled across <a href="http://jsoftware.com/">J</a>.</p>

<p>J and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)">the entire family of APL languages</a> have a beautiful terseness and closeness to the data being operated on. They’re also fundamentally designed to operate on arrays, a data structure ripe for musical interpretation. I’ve convinced myself that if I can learn J, I’ll be able to build the live coding environment of my dreams!</p>

<p>That’s a big goal, but I’m taking baby steps to get there. Today, I’ll show you how I managed to make noise with J.</p>

<h2 id="making-noise-without-j">Making Noise Without J</h2>

<p>My plan for making noise with J doesn’t actually involve my J software producing any noise directly. Instead, it’ll act as a controller that instructs other software on my machine to make noise on its behalf.</p>

<p>The software making the noise will be <a href="http://notahat.com/simplesynth/">SimpleSynth</a>, which is a small, easy to use MIDI synthesizer. If you’re following along, feel free to use any other MIDI synth you’d like, or a full audio workstation like <a href="https://www.ableton.com/en/">Ableton</a> or even <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/garageband/">GarageBand</a>.</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/making-noise-with-j/1.png" />
  <p>SimpleSynth.</p>
</div>

<p>When we fire up SimpleSynth, it’ll ask which MIDI source it should use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> is a protocol that lets us pass around musical information, like when and how loud certain notes should be played, between different devices. SimpleSynth is asking which stream of notes it should listen to and play.</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/making-noise-with-j/3.png" />
  <p>Setting up our J virtual device in MIDI Studio.</p>
</div>

<p>I used MacOS’ built-in MIDI Studio to create a virtual MIDI channel called “J”, with a MIDI port called “Bus 1.” After making sure the virtual device was online, I selected it in SimpleSynth.</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/making-noise-with-j/2.png" />
  <p>Selecting our J virtual device in SimpleSynth.</p>
</div>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle is finding some way of programmatically sending MIDI messages through my “J Bus 1” to be played by SimpleSynth. Geert Bevin’s <a href="https://github.com/gbevin/SendMIDI">SendMIDI</a> command line tool did just the trick.</p>

<p>Once installed, we can use SendMIDI to send MIDI notes to SimpleSynth from our command line:</p>

<pre class="language-j"><code class="language-j">sendmidi dev "J Bus 1" on 60 100
</code></pre>

<p>Turning <code class="language-j">on</code> note <code class="language-j">60</code>, with a velocity of <code class="language-j">100</code> effectively plays a middle C at full volume.</p>

<p>Now we’re making music!</p>

<h2 id="talking-to-sendmidi-with-j">Talking to SendMIDI with J</h2>

<p>The next challenge lies in getting J to execute <code class="language-j">sendmidi</code> commands.</p>

<p>After much searching and head scratching, I learned that J exposes <a href="https://twitter.com/seanstickle/status/1000766939193634825">a wide range of miscellaneous functionality</a> under <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/help/dictionary/d412.htm">the “foreigns” (<code class="language-j">!:</code>) verb</a>. Calling <code class="language-j">2!:1 y</code> lets you spawn a new process, running whatever command you pass in through <code class="language-j">y</code>.</p>

<p>Let’s try invoking our spawn verb with our <code class="language-j">sendmidi</code> command:</p>

<pre class="language-j"><code class="language-j">   2!:1 'sendmidi dev "J Bus 1" on 60 100'
|interface error
|       2!:1'sendmidi dev "J Bus 1" on 60 100'
</code></pre>

<p>After even more searching and head scratching, I realized that I needed to use the fully-qualified <code class="language-j">sendmidi</code> path when making the call:</p>

<pre class="language-j"><code class="language-j">   2!:1 '/usr/local/bin/sendmidi dev "J Bus 1" on 60 100'
</code></pre>

<p>I hear sound! Success!</p>

<h2 id="making-music-with-j">Making Music with J</h2>

<p>While this is great, it’s not much better just running our <code class="language-j">sendmidi</code> command directly from the command line. What would make things even better is if we could build ourselves a <code class="language-j">play</code> verb that plays any notes passed to it.</p>

<p>For example, if I were to run:</p>

<pre class="language-j"><code class="language-j">   play 60 64 67
</code></pre>

<p>I’d expect J to construct and execute our <code class="language-j">sendmidi</code> command, which should play a C major chord:</p>

<pre class="language-j"><code class="language-j">sendmidi dev "J Bus 1" on 60 100 on 64 100 on 67 100
</code></pre>

<p>After a few brain-expanding weekends of playing around in J, I came up with this version of the <code class="language-j">play</code> verb:</p>

<pre class="language-j"><code class="language-j">   on =: ('on ',5|.' 100 ',":)"0
   play =: [:2!:1'/usr/local/bin/sendmidi dev "J Bus 1" ',[:,/on
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-j">on</code> verb turns an integer note into an “on string” of the format, <code class="language-j">'on &lt;note&gt; 100 '</code>, and the <code class="language-j">play</code> verb spawns the result of appending <code class="language-j">'/usr/local/bin/sendmidi ...'</code> to append mapped over <code class="language-j">on</code> applied to <code class="language-j">y</code>.</p>

<p>Put simply, it constructs our <code class="language-j">sendmidi</code> command and executes it.</p>

<p>We can play a C major chord:</p>

<pre class="language-j"><code class="language-j">   play 60 64 67
</code></pre>

<p>Or any other chord we want:</p>

<pre class="language-j"><code class="language-j">   play 60 63 54 70 73
</code></pre>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Please keep in mind that I’m very new to J, and even newer to tacit programming. If you see anything that can be improved, clarified, or corrected, please <a href="https://twitter.com/petecorey">let me know</a>.</p>

<p>I still feel very clunky and slow when it comes to using J. Building this two line program took hours of my time. That said, I feel like there is potential here. As I grow more used to the tacit paradigm and play with other ways of interacting to DAWs and other audio producers, I feel like J might turn into my ideal music creation environment.</p>

<p>Time will tell.</p></p>

<p>In this article, I want to talk about a really simple technique for evolving line-art from pictures. On top of being an simple example for genetic algorithms, it is also a fun programming project that can be done in short time. For this project, we are going to use the Hill Climbing algorithm. The algorithm for evolving pictures is like the following. Create two empty images, image 1 and image 2 Do a small random modification (like a line) to the first image If the first image is closer to the target than the first one, copy it to image 2 Otherwise, copy the second image to image 1 Goto 2 I will be using Rust for this project.</p></p>

<h4><a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/2018/06/25/Massacring-C-Pointers/index.html">Massacring C Pointers</a></h4>
<p>
<p>
I'm taking a break from debugging books to talk about a calamitous shitshow of textbook writing: <i>Mastering C Pointers: Tools for Programming Power</i>, by Robert J. Traister.
</p>

<p>
I learned of the book through a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SUkrR7ZfTA">talk</a> by Brian Kernighan where he refers to the book as probably “the worst C programming textbook ever written.”<sup><a id="fnr.1" class="footref" href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/rss.xml#fn.1">1</a></sup>
He doesn't name it but <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr/status/1003411102791692288">with some help</a> I was able to track down his obliquely accurate reference.
</p>

<p>
This book has become my <a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=white%20whale">white whale</a>.
Since I started reading debugging books, and especially now that I'm digging through older ones, I find bits of advice that simply don't work today.
While some of it could be construed as useless or idiotic, I've always found the authors come from a position of earnestness, attempting to draw the best conclusions based on decent principles and what they knew at the time they wrote it.
In some cases they may not have known much, but they're honestly and humbly trying to impart some wisdom.
</p>

<p>
When Kernighan put up the following example, I saw what seemed to be the opposite of that.
</p>

<pre class="example">
char *combine(s, t)
char *s, *t;
{

      int x, y;
      char r[100];

      strcpy(r, s);
      y = strlen(r);
      for (x = y; *t != '\0'; ++x)
           r[x] = *t++;

      r[x] = '\0';

      return(r);

}
</pre>

<p>
This program (formatting preserved) is taken from the first edition of the book (p.146).
It's horrific (Kernighan calls it “malpractice”).
It does not exhibit the genuineness I have seen with, say, books from the late 1970s on how to debug BASIC programs.
I didn't know what it was.
Deceit?
Laziness?
Unremitting ignorance?
What is the mindset of someone who writes this, presumably thinking it's a good idea?
Can the whole book be that bad?
Kernighan said it was.
I had to know.
</p>

<p>
The book has two editions: the first was published in 1990, the second in 1993.
The fact that there are two editions piqued my curiosity even more.
It sold enough to make another version?
Is that horrible example corrected?
I obtained a copy of each and read them.
</p>

<p>
Reviewing the book is pointless.
Kernighan was right: it's garbage.
And the second edition only makes things worse.
Teaching from either one would be a breach of ethics.
If you follow Traister’s coding practices, even adjusted for today's standards, you are <i>guaranteed</i> to create defects and vicious, latent bugs.
A subtly pernicious aspect of the book is the casual tone of the writing.
It’s informal enough that if you don’t really know much about C what he says sort of makes sense, despite the sloppy terminology and mixed, inaccurate metaphors.
</p>

<p>
Any trained programmer will recognize the lessons as worthless.
His terminology is all over the map and typically inaccurate, if not plainly wrong.
Expressions “return a value.”
Values are “handed” into locations.
Constants are “written directly into the program.”
A union is a “specialized pointer.”
The terminology isn’t even consistent.
Micro-optimizations are stressed at all times, and program efficiency is valued over comprehension.
He can’t even define a pointer correctly: “A pointer is a special variable that returns the address of a memory location.”
It does not take long to realize Traister has no idea what he’s talking about.
</p>

<p>
Although I’m not going to go over the content (that would take far too long since there’s nothing redeeming there), I did take extensive notes.
You can <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/notes.html">read them</a>, if you are so inclined.
</p>

<p>
I must, however, take a moment to single out the code.
It is universally bad and much of it is simply wrong.
(Imagine trying to learn programming principles from a book that contains a large number of programs that don’t even compile.)
I’ve <a href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/code.html">transcribed</a> some of the programs and annotated them with comments so that you can get a taste of how inept Traister is as a C programmer.
One thing to keep in mind (both for the programs and the notes) is that C89/C90 was new at the time and that the code was written on (and for) MS-DOS systems of the late 1980s/early 1990s.
Things were a bit different then.
</p>

<p>
Enough about the material.
I want to explore the question of how something so wrong even got written.  It’s not that everything in the book is wrong, but it feels like when it’s right, it’s right by accident.
</p>

<p>
Traister has <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Robert-J.-Traister/e/B001H6UPHY/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1529540256&sr=1-1">written</a> other books, some about electronics and some about programming, one called <i>Going from BASIC to C</i>.
In <i>Mastering C Pointers</i>, he talks about a product he created called CBREEZE that converts BASIC code to C.
Throughout the book he makes passing, roundabout references to BASIC and uses terminology that suggests he’s written a lot of BASIC code.
For example, there is a whole chapter on using pointers to access memory, where reading and writing memory is instead called “peeking” and “poking”, based on the PEEK and POKE instructions in BASIC.
He also says that it took him a couple of tries to learn C coming from BASIC.
In short, I’m convinced he’s knowledgeable about BASIC and has worked on writing software for small, electronic devices.
</p>

<p>
Why is this important?
As I read the book (and if you read my notes, you know where this is going) I started to notice something in the wording and tone.
The further I progressed the more I became convinced of it, and I think it explains how he managed to mangle the explanation of C pointers so badly.
</p>

<p>
I don’t think he understands the call stack.
</p>

<p>
My argument for this interpretation requires a little knowledge of BASIC and embedded devices.
</p>

<p>
With BASIC, the key thing to know about most implementations at the time is that there were no functions and no scope aside from the global scope.<sup><a id="fnr.2" class="footref" href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/rss.xml#fn.2">2</a></sup>
The closest thing to a function in BASIC is the GOSUB command.
The GOSUB command jumps to a line and executes code until it gets to a RETURN statement, where control is transferred back to the line following the GOSUB command.
Within a GOSUB you can jump somewhere else with another GOSUB.
The control follows a stack principle, but no arguments are passed.
GOSUB routines are a way to factor out common code, but that common code has to work on global variables.
(And yes, it’s as terrible as it sounds.)
</p>

<p>
Now, consider the case of simple electronic devices.
Even today some embedded devices, usually programmed using C, do not have a call stack that dynamically allocates space for automatic variables.
There simply isn’t enough memory for it.
Instead, the compiler lays out memory such that each function’s local variables have fixed memory addresses (a “compiled stack” model).
The only stack you have is for return addresses and it is probably handled in hardware.
</p>

<p>
Suppose you’re used to writing BASIC for small memory electronic devices and you learn about C.
You read about pointers and realize something: it’s possible to write a subroutine that can change variables <i>without knowing their names</i>.
It’s manna from heaven!
You don’t have to devote global variables to being the “parameters” of your subroutines anymore.
Life is great.
</p>

<p>
This is the mindset I think Traister had and never got past.
In the book there is one fleeting mention of the stack in reference to excessive (automatic) memory allocation.
(On MS-DOS, if the space for local variables is too large in the program, it might not compile.)
He consistently describes variables as having “exclusive” addresses in the program.
His writing about pointers suggests that he thinks, for each function, space is set aside to hold the local variables for the duration of the program, but you can only access them when inside the function in which they were declared.
So pointers are really powerful because you can provide this address to another function and it can change the value using only a parameter.
</p>

<p>
Further evidence for his lack of understanding is that he frequently cites ridiculous space micro-optimizations within functions, such as avoiding the use of integers for index variables, if possible.
Another one, mentioned often, is local <code>char</code> arrays that have a fixed size.
There are good reasons to not use them but his are not among them.
His admonishment is that they waste space.
Technically, that is true, but they don't exist until they're on the stack.
And he never talks about global or file variables.
He only refers to locals with “exclusive” addresses “set aside” for variables.
</p>

<p>
This interpretation runs into some problems once you start asking how functions with malloc will work, but it's worth pointing out that there is almost no discussion about memory management.
In a book devoted to C pointers, that's a toxic mix of gross negligence and incompetence.
There is literally one short paragraph devoted to talking about the <code>free</code> function&#x2014;and it's characterized as a “side note.”
</p>

<p>
Another sticking point in this interpretation is Traister’s incomprehensible approach to writing functions that take a variable number of arguments.
He does this by passing an arbitrary number of arguments to a function (the first being the number of arguments) and accessing them using offsets from the address of the first argument.
This suggests he has some idea about parameters being passed in a dynamic fashion, but it is so spectacularly wrong<sup><a id="fnr.3" class="footref" href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/rss.xml#fn.3">3</a></sup> you’re left wondering if he even tried his programs out before publishing them.
</p>

<p>
Honestly, this is the most generous interpretation of the text I could come up with, and it still paints a terrible picture.
Occam's Razor suggests that Traister is just clueless.
But like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01l1WIC9mBo">analyzing a terrible movie</a> that somehow gets made, it's more fun to reason through the “behind the scenes” parts.
</p>

<p>
Given the ineptness of the book, you'd think it was self-published.
You would be wrong.
It was published through Academic Press, which was a division of Harcourt, Brace &amp; World at the time, but is now an “imprint of Elsevier.”
</p>

<p>
In the preface of the second edition it says that the first edition was reviewed “by a professional C programmer hired by the publisher.”
That programmer said it should not be published.
That programmer was right, but the publisher went ahead and published it anyway.
</p>

<p>
Since there was a second edition, the assumption is that the book sold well.
According to WorldCat, <i>Mastering C Pointers</i> is in at least <a href="https://www.worldcat.org/title/mastering-c-pointers/oclc/898329209&referer=brief_results">242 libraries</a>, most appearing to be the first edition, but I didn’t check them all.<sup><a id="fnr.4" class="footref" href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/rss.xml#fn.4">4</a></sup>
It claims to be one of the first books to tackle the subject of pointers in C, which is often a sticking point for novice programmers.
The lack of material in this area at the time is probably why it sold.
I could not track down a review of this book anywhere (and yes, I looked through scans of Byte Magazine et al.), but I did find reviews for other C books in the 1980s and what I found suggested that pointers were not covered well, if at all.
In other words, like many books&#x2014;and tech books in particular&#x2014;it sold because of its title and good timing.<sup><a id="fnr.5" class="footref" href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/rss.xml#fn.5">5</a></sup>
</p>

<p>
If you browse search results for other books by Traister you’ll find a lot of questionable sounding titles: <i>Making money with your microcomputer</i> (1982), <i>Leaping from BASIC to C++</i> (1994), <i>Learn C in Two Weeks with Run/C and CBreeze</i> (1987).
The breadth of topics covered in his works seems exhausting: <i>Beginner’s Guide to Reading Schematics</i> (1991), <i>Astronomy and Telescopes: A Beginner’s Handbook</i> (1983), <i>Make your own professional home video recordings</i> (1982), <i>Cave Exploring</i> (1983), just to name a few.
You start to wonder if this is actually the same person who writes all this.
Then you start to wonder if maybe all these books just touch on the topics, and are churned out mainly to try and make a buck.
I had a hard time finding a review for any of them (the best resource was <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=robert%20j%20traister&sin=TXT">archive.org</a>).
Practically all I could find about his books was ads for them&#x2014;and even then it wasn’t that much, which is odd given the apparent volume of output from him.
I did manage to find two reviews for his book <i>Programming in C for the Microcomputer User</i> (1984): one was favourable (80 Micro, Nov. 1984), the other was not (Practical Computing, Oct. 1985).
The only other book I can find of his that seems to have some staying power is the schematics book, which went to a third edition.<sup><a id="fnr.6" class="footref" href="https://wozniak.ca/blog/rss.xml#fn.6">6</a></sup>
</p>

Ultimately, the aspect of <i>Mastering C Pointers</i> that truly disturbs me is that there are probably a fair number of people who actually learned C pointers from it.
There’s no way to know how much of an impact this book had on programmers in the 1990s, but given the number of copies in libraries it must have had some.
It’s hard not to wonder how much of the terrible C code that has made its way into production can be attributed to the awful advice in Traister’s travesty of a text.

TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework, is actually more generally a platform for doing computation over tensors in the structure of a graph.
Cryptographic algorithms are frequently structured as the manipulation of vectors and matrices of bytes in the structure of a graph.
You might begin to see where this is going.
What follows is a completely frivolous experiment to implement various cryptographic algorithms in TensorFlow.

<div class="info">
    Posted on June 23, 2018
    
        by Noon van der Silk
    
</div>

<div>
<p>I stumbled across this blogpost of <a href="http://www.corentindupont.info/blog/posts/Programming/2015-09-14-diagrams.html">Corentin Dupont</a> where he put together a library that allows you to modify your hakyll blog so that you can have inline diagrams! As anyone knows, this was amazingly exciting to me, because I love <a href="https://archives.haskell.org/projects.haskell.org/diagrams/"><code>diagrams</code></a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So I quickly tried to set it up; but, much to my sadness it didn’t immediately work.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Luckily, however, I was able to make it worked by hacking around in the two relevant repos:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/diagrams-pandoc">diagrams-pandoc</a>
</div></li>
<li><div>
<a href="https://github.com/silky/hakyll-diagrams">hakyll-diagrams</a>
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>The main result is a function, <code>pandocCompilerDiagrams</code>, that I included into my hakyll site file like so:</p>
</div>
<div>
<pre><code>match &quot;posts/*&quot; $ do
    route $ setExtension &quot;html&quot;
    compile $ 
            (pandocCompilerDiagrams &quot;images/diagrams&quot; &lt;|&gt; pandocMathCompiler)
        &gt;&gt;= loadAndApplyTemplate &quot;templates/post.html&quot;    postCtx
        &gt;&gt;= saveSnapshot &quot;content&quot;
        &gt;&gt;= loadAndApplyTemplate &quot;templates/default.html&quot; postCtx
        &gt;&gt;= relativizeUrls</code></pre>
</div>
<div>
<p>And so now, I can have inline diagrams! Check it out:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Imagine we had a circle:</p>
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>But now, what if the circle was repeated 5 times</p>
</div>

<h4><a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2018/06/20/littles-law.html">Telling Stories About Little's Law</a></h4>
<p>
<h1>Telling Stories About Little's Law</h1>

<p class="meta">Building Up Intuition with Narrative</p>


<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little's_law">Little's Law</a> is widely used as a tool for understanding the behavior of distributed systems. The law says that the mean concurrency in the system (𝐿) is equal to the mean rate at which requests arrive (λ) multiplied by the mean time that each request spends in the system (𝑊):</p>

<p>𝐿 = λ𝑊</p>

<p>As I've <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2017/12/28/mean.html">written about before</a>, Little's law is useful because it gives us a clear way to reason about the capacity of a system, which is often difficult to observe directly, based on quantities like arrival rate (requests per second) and latency which are easier to measure directly. Concurrency is a useful measure of capacity in real systems, because it directly measures consumption of resources like threads, memory, connections, file handles and anything else that's numerically limited. It also provides an indirect way to think about contention: if the concurrency in a system is high, then it's likely that contention is also high.</p>

<p>I like Little's Law as a mathematical tool, but also as a narrative tool. It provides a powerful way to frame stories about system behavior.</p>

<h3>Feedback</h3>

<p>The way Little's Law is written, each of the terms are long-term averages, and λ and 𝑊 are independent. In the real world, distributed systems don't tend to actually behave this nicely.</p>

<p>Request time (𝑊) tends to increase as concurrency (𝐿) increases. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law">Amdahl's Law</a> provides the simplest model of this: each request has some portion of work which is trivially parallelizable, and some portion of work that is forced to be serialized in some way. Amdahl's law is also wildly optimistic: most real-world systems don't see throughput level out under contention, but rather see throughput drop as contention rises beyond some limit. The <a href="http://www.perfdynamics.com/Manifesto/USLscalability.html">universal scalability law</a> captures one model of this behavior. The fundamental reason for this is that contention itself has a cost.</p>

<p>Even in the naive, beautiful, Amdahl world, latency increases as load increases because throughput starts to approach some maximum. In the USL world, this increase can be dramatically non-linear. In both cases 𝑊 is a function of 𝐿.</p>

<p>Arrival rate (λ) also depends on request time (𝑊), and typically in a non-linear way. There are three ways to see this relationship:</p>

<ul>
<li>Arrival rate drops as request time increases (λ ∝ 1/𝑊). In this model there is a finite number of clients and each has its own finite concurrency (or, in the simplest world is calling serially in a loop). As each call goes up, clients keep their concurrency fixed, so the arrival rate drops.</li>
<li>Arrival rate does not depend on latency. If clients don't change their behavior based on how long requests take, or on requests failing, then there's no relationship. The widely-used Poisson process client model behaves this way.</li>
<li>Arrival rate increases as request time increases (λ ∝ 𝑊). One cause of this is <em>timeout and retry</em>: if a client sees a request exceed some maximum time (so 𝑊>𝜏) they may retry. If that timeout 𝜏 is shorter than their typical inter-call time, this will increase the per-client rate. Other kinds of stateful client behavior can also kick in here. For example, clients may interpret long latencies as errors that don't only need to be retried, but can trigger entire call chains to be retried.</li>
</ul>


<p>The combination of these effects tends to be that the dynamic behavior of distributed systems has scary cliffs. Systems have plateaus where they behave well where 𝑊, 𝐿 and λ are either close-to-independent or inversely proportional, and cliffs where direct proportionality kicks in and they spiral down to failure. Throttling, admission control, back pressure, backoff and other mechanisms can play a big role in avoiding these cliffs, but they still exist.</p>

<h3>Arrival Processes and Spiky Behavior</h3>

<p>The mean, <a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/2017/12/28/mean.html">like all descriptive statistics</a>, doesn't tell the whole story about data. The mean is very convenient in the mathematics of Little's law, but tends to hide effects caused by high-percentile behavior. Little's law's use of long-term means also tends to obscure the fact that real-world statistical processes are frequently non-stationary: they include trends, cycles, spikes and seasonality which are not well-modeled as a single stationary time series. Non-stationary behavior can affect 𝑊, but is most noticeable in the arrival rate λ.</p>

<p>There are many causes for changes in λ. Seasonality is a big one: the big gift-giving holidays, big sporting events, and other large correlated events can significantly increase arrival rate during some period of time. Human clients tend to exhibit significant daily, weekly, and yearly cycles. People like to sleep. For many systems, though, the biggest cause of spikes is the combination of human biases and computer precision: <em>cron</em> jobs. When humans pick a time for a task to be done (<em>backup once a day</em>, <em>ping once a minute</em>), they don't tend to pick a uniformly random time. Instead, they cluster the work around the boundaries of months, days, hours, minutes and seconds. This leads to significant spikes of traffic, and pushes the distribution of arrival time away from the Poisson process ideal<sup><a href="http://brooker.co.za/blog/rss.xml#foot1">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Depending on how you define <em>long term mean</em>, these cyclic changes in λ can either show up in the distribution of λ as high percentiles, or show up in λ being non-stationary. Depending on the data and the size of the spikes it's still possible to get useful results out of Little's law, but they will be less precise and potentially more misleading.</p>

<h3>Telling Stories</h3>

<p>Somewhat inspired by Little's law, we can build up a difference equation that captures more of real-world behavior:</p>

<p>W<sub>n+1</sub> = 𝑊(L<sub>n</sub>, λ<sub>n</sub>, t)</p>

<p>λ<sub>n+1</sub> = λ(L<sub>n</sub>, W<sub>n</sub>, t)</p>

<p>L<sub>n+1</sub> = λ<sub>n+1</sub> 𝑊<sub>n+1</sub></p>

<p>I find that this is a powerful mental model, even if it's lacking some precision and is hard to use for clean closed-form results. Breaking the behavior of the system down into time steps provides a way to tell a story about the way the system behaves in the next time step, and how the long-term behavior of the system emerges. It's also useful for building simple simulations of the dynamics of systems.</p>

<p>Telling stories about our systems, for all its potential imprecision, is a powerful way to build and communicate intuition.</p>

<p><em>The system was ticking along nicely, then just after midnight a spike of requests from arrived from a flash sale. This caused latency to increase because of increased lock contention on the database, which in turn caused 10% of client calls to time-out and be retried. A bug in backoff in our client meant that this increased call rate to 10x the normal for this time of day, further increasing contention.</em> And so on...</p>

<p>Each step in the story evolves by understanding the relationship between latency, concurrency and arrival rate. The start of the story is almost always some triggering event that increases latency or arrival rate, and the end is some action or change that breaks the cycle. Each step in the story offers an opportunity to identify something to make the system more robust. Can we reduce the increase in 𝑊 when λ increases? Can we reduce the increase in λ when 𝑊 exceeds a certain bound? Can we break the cycle without manual action?</p>

<p>The typical resiliency tools, like backoff, backpressure and throttling, are all answers to these types of questions, but are far from the full set of answers. Telling the stories allows us to look for more answers.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/06/18/limiting-peers-with-dynamicsupervisor-options/">Limiting Peers with DynamicSupervisor Options</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Last month <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/05/21/spreading-through-the-bitcoin-network/">I posted an article</a> about using Elixir’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">DynamicSupervisor</span></code> behavior to recursively connect our Elixir-based node to peers throughout Bitcoin’s peer-to-peer network.</p>

<p>The last part of that article talked about how we could limit the exponential growth of our set of connected peers by setting a hard cap on the number of processes supervised by our dynamic <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Node</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Supervisor</span></code> process.</p>

<p>We went through the rigmarole of building this child process cap ourselves, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/elixir/comments/8ljzr1/spreading_through_the_bitcoin_network/e0m2sv4/">it was pointed out to me</a> that we could have used <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">DynamicSupervisor</span></code>’s built in <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:max_children</span></code> option to accomplish the same thing!</p>

<h2 id="our-hand-rolled-solution">Our Hand-Rolled Solution</h2>

<p>When we implemented our own restriction on the number of peers we allow our node to connect to, we did it within the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">BitcoinNetwork</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect_to_node</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def connect_to_node(ip, port) do
  if count_peers() &lt; Application.get_env(:bitcoin_network, :max_peers) do
    DynamicSupervisor.start_child(BitcoinNetwork.Node.Supervisor, %{
      id: BitcoinNetwork.Node,
      start: {BitcoinNetwork.Node, :start_link, [{ip, port}]},
      restart: :transient
    })
  else
    {:error, :max_peers}
  end

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">count_peers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">0</span></code> helper function simply calls out to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">DynamicSupervisor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">count_children</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> to count the number of processes being supervised by our dynamic <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Node</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Supervisor</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
BitcoinNetwork.Node.Supervisor
|&gt; DynamicSupervisor.count_children()
|&gt; Map.get(:active)
</code></pre>

<p>If the number of active peers is less than our specified number of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:max_peers</span></code>, we allow the connection. Otherwise, we return an <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:error</span></code> tuple.</p>

<h2 id="elixirs-solution">Elixir’s Solution</h2>

<p>If we read through <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/DynamicSupervisor.html#t:init_option/0">the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">DynamicSupervisor</span></code> documentation</a>, we’ll find that we can pass a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:max_children</span></code> option to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">DynamicSupervisor</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">start_link</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>. Digging through Elixir’s source, we can see that, when present, <a href="https://github.com/elixir-lang/elixir/blob/v1.6.5/lib/elixir/lib/dynamic_supervisor.ex#L627-L635">the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:max_children</span></code> option does literally exactly what we did in our hand-rolled solution</a>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
if dynamic &lt; max_children do
  handle_start_child(child, %{state | dynamic: dynamic + 1})
else
  {:reply, {:error, :max_children}, state}
end
</code></pre>

<p>If <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">dynamic</span></code>, the number of processes currently being supervised by the supervisor, is less than the specified <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">max_children</span></code>, add the child. Otherwise, return an <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:error</span></code> tuple.</p>

<h2 id="refactoring">Refactoring</h2>

<p>Refactoring our original solution to make use of the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:max_children</span></code> option largely consists of removing our original solution. We’ll start by gutting the guard in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">BitcoinNetwork</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">connect_to_node</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def connect_to_node(ip, port) do
  DynamicSupervisor.start_child(BitcoinNetwork.Node.Supervisor, %{
    id: BitcoinNetwork.Node,
    start: {BitcoinNetwork.Node, :start_link, [{ip, port}]},
    restart: :transient
  })
end
</code></pre>

<p>This means we can also remove our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">count_peers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">0</span></code> helper function.</p>

<p>Now we simply need to add the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:max_children</span></code> option to our dynamic supervisor when it starts up:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{:ok, pid} =
  Supervisor.start_link(
    [
      {DynamicSupervisor,
        name: BitcoinNetwork.Node.Supervisor,
        strategy: :one_for_one,
        max_children: Application.get_env(:bitcoin_network, :max_peers)}
    ],
    strategy: :one_for_one
  )
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all there is to it!</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/limiting-peers-with-dynamicsupervisor-options/01.png" />
  <p>Our limited set of peers.</p>
</div>

<p>Spinning up our Bitcoin node with a low value for <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:max_peers</span></code> shows that our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Node</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Supervisor</span></code> is honoring our limit.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>My final thoughts are that I should really spend more time reading through the Elixir and Erlang documentation. There’s quite a few gems hidden in plain sight that would do me quite a bit of good to know about.</p>

<p>I’d also like to thank the Redditor who pointed the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:max_children</span></code> option out to me.

<div>
<p>I’ve been reading “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Surfaces-Essences-Analogy-Fuel-Thinking/dp/0465018475/">Surfaces and Essences</a>” by Doug Hofstadter and Emmanuel Sander.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div>
</div>

<div>
<p>You can essentially judge this book by it’s cover: It argues that analogies are the key technique we use to think and understand. I quite love this book, in particular because it presents lots of interesting ideas for people interested in the topic, and for people interested in AI and machine learning.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The reason I enjoy this book so much is because I think it presents a very strong task for machine learning people to tackle; namely to build a system that is capable of this analogical reasoning. One thing that’s true of <strong>all</strong> modern machine learning systems it that their knowlege is very “narrow” and, almost all of the time, the bounds of it are determined entirely before training.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In any case, we’re focused right now on translation. Doug recently wrote about his thoughts here: <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/the-shallowness-of-google-translate/551570/">The Shallowness of Google Translate</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I’m not going to go into a lot of detail here; I just want to track the progress of a specific phrase that Doug and Emmanuel hvea in the book. They started tracking it in 2004, and it being 2018 now; 14 years later! I wanted to see how things had progressed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Here’s the complex paragraph (in French) and the task is to translate it into English:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Original</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Parfois, le succès ne fut pas au rendez-vous. On a beau y penser très fort, le bon numéro ne sort pas forcément. Sagan prenait échecs d’auteur dramatique comme les revers casino, avec respect pour les caprices de la banque et du ciel. Il faut bien pedre un peu, pour mieux savourer la gagne du lendemain. Qui ne l’a pas vue « récupérer » en quelques quarts d’heure les pertes de toute une nuit ne peut comprendre comme c’est joyeux de narguer le sort.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Human-translation by Doug and Emmanuel</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Sometimes things just didn’t work out right; no matter how har she wished for it, the dice simply wouldn’t come up her way. But Sagan always took her failures as a playwright much as she took her gambling losses, acknowledging the arbitrary whims of the house and of divine fate. After all, everyone has to lose now and then, so that the next day’s victory will taste all the sweeter. And if you never saw her win back a whole night’s losses, often in well under an hour, you just can’t have any idea of the glee she took in laughing in the face of destiny.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p>Then here are the translations over the years (the first two coming from the book itself):</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Google Translate, 2004</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Sometimes, success was not with go. One thinks of it in vain very extremely, the good number does not leave inevitable. Sagan took the failures of dramatic author like in the reverses of casino, with respect for the whims of the bank and the sky. It is necessary well to lose a little, for better enjoying gains it following day. Who did not see it “recovering” in a few fifteen minutes the losses of a whole night cannot include/understand as they is merry of narguer the fate.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><em>Verdict</em>: Terrible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Google Translate, 2009</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Sometimes, success was not there. It was nice to think very hard, the proper number does not necessarily spell. Sagan took the failures as a dramatist such as backhand casino, with respect to the whims of the Bank and the sky. It must be losig a little, better enjoy the gains overnight. Who did not see “recover” in a few minutes lost a whole night can not understand how happy it is the sort of taunt.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><em>Verdict</em>: Still terrible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Google Translate, 2018</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>
<div>
<p>Sometimes the success was not there. We can think about it very well, the good number does not necessarily come out. Sagan took dramatic draftsman’s chess like the casino setbacks, with respect for the whims of the bank and the sky. It is necessary to lose a little, to better savor the gain of tomorrow. Whoever has not seen her “recover” in a few quarters of an hour the losses of a whole night can not understand how happy it is to taunt the spell.</p>
</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<p><em>Verdict</em>: <em>Still</em> terrible, 14 years later!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It’s very interesting to think about how to build systems that could conveivably translate phrases like this “properly”, by using the ideas from the book.</p>

<h4><a href="https://cryptolosophy.org/pursuit-of-posthumous-peace/">The Pursuit of Posthumous Peace</a></h4>
<p>
The origin of religion is likely in the human need for some way to cope with the unknown. Each person must formulate some internal philosophy for their existence which will then guide their outlook and actions in life. The philosophy that you decide to stick with will have a pretty significant impact on you, down to who you are as a person and how you think. The most common is probably the heaven or hell ultimatum, aka infinite reward vs. infinite retribution. Followers of this hypothesis believe that they are in control of some probability of reaching heaven, where is the set of possible choices made in a lifetime. In this situation, the control over is what lends the believer comfort in death. But it is a precarious comfort. See, the ideal behaviour of is such that as you approach death, the probability of achieving infinite reward should approach one. As in, as you age, you’ll control the in such that, As long as this trend exists, you may lead a happy life (or at least a life without worrying about what will happen when you die). Of course at could also suddenly be close to, without converging to, one (and vice versa), but that hardly constitutes a life free of worry. But if this trend doesn’t exist—say the opposite is true and actually approaches zero—then what? Your problems have been exacerbated and now instead of worrying about the unknown, you’re worrying about eternal damnation. (There’s also the consideration that having to be careful about all is a pretty restricting way to live, but if one can find happiness in it, as many do, then that’s not an issue.) The opposing view is that there is no god and that after death there is absolutely nothing. You cease to exist, and there is no longer a you to say “I am”. The question you could ask yourself is why—if we didn’t experience the first ~14 billion years before we existed—would we experience the next N after we stop existing? xkcd: Beliefs This view stems from various different schools of thought (simulation hypothesis, atheism, agnosticism, etc) that all share the conviction that we are simply the inevitable result of probability, time, and the principle of natural selection—since that’s the scientifically accepted model of the universe. The idea is to believe only what you can justify believing and discard everything else. It is a comforting belief to hold too: when someone you love inevitably shuffles off this mortal coil, you will know that they’re not suffering. Everyone is guaranteed to be at ultimate peace, which is a gift that monotheism cannot provide. By adopting this philosophy you will lose out on the potential infinite happiness promised by monotheists, but you will also ultimately be avoiding hell. There’s also a third option: reincarnation. It shares some resemblance with the monotheistic approach in that control over your actions, , determines your afterlife, but that’s where the similarities end. Instead of being designated to heaven or hell, you are instead “reborn” as a new being where you will again be given control over your actions, and again, and again, each time either improving or worsening the situation in your next life. Reincarnation is an interesting one because it focuses on individual peace as opposed to comfort in relationships. You are constantly trying to live your own best life such that your next one is even better, all the while being unable to remember your past. It provides similar levels of comfort in death as monotheism does, and yet neither the happiness nor the suffering are eternal. There’s always another chance. But at the end of the day, all of these “philosophies” are just different things that we tell ourselves to keep away the monster at night. Our beliefs are potentially limitless and our knowledge is limited by our senses, so what do we really know? We just have to choose.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/06/11/generating-test-fixtures-with-wireshark/">Generating Test Fixtures with Wireshark</a></h4>
<p>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/bitcoin_network/">in-progress Elixir-based Bitcoin node</a> is woefully lacking on the test front. This is especially problematic considering how finicky <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation">the Bitcoin protocol parsing and serialization process can be</a>.</p>

<p>But how can we test this functionality without going through the mind-numbing process of manually constructing each packet under test and asserting that it parses and serializes as expected?</p>

<p>Thankfully, Wireshark’s support of the Bitcoin protocol turns this into a simple task. Let’s dig into how we can use <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">Wireshark</a> to generate binary fixtures for each of our Bitcoin packets under test, and explore how we can test against them using Elixir.</p>

<h2 id="generating-our-fixtures">Generating Our Fixtures</h2>

<p>Wireshark supports the Bitcoin protocol out of the box. That makes the process of generating test fixtures incredibly simple. To create a binary fixture for a given Bitcoin packet, we just need to follow these three steps:</p>

<p>Step one: Fire up Wireshark, start capturing on your network interface, and set <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">bitcoin</span></code> as your display filter:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/generating-test-fixtures-with-wireshark/01.png" />
  <p>Filtering for bitcoin packets.</p>
</div>

<p>Step two: Start <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">bitcoind</span></code>, and watch the packets roll in:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/generating-test-fixtures-with-wireshark/02.png" />
  <p>Bitcoin packets on the wire.</p>
</div>

<p>Step three: Notice that Wireshark teases out the Bitcoin-specific portion of every matching TCP packet it receives. Each packet can be exported by right clicking on the “Bitcoin protocol” breakdown, and choosing “Export Packet Bytes.”</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/generating-test-fixtures-with-wireshark/03.png" />
  <p>High level packet information.</p>
</div>

<p>The bytes we’re exporting represent the entire packet, as it comes in over the wire.</p>

<h2 id="parsing-our-fixtures">Parsing Our Fixtures</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve saved a handful of packets we’d like to test against, we can start the process of incorporating them into our test suite.</p>

<p>Let’s assume that we’ve saved all of our exported packets into a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">test</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">fixtures</span></code> folder within our project. Let’s also assume that we want to start by testing our “version” packet (the most interesting packet we’re able to parse, so far).</p>

<p>Let’s make a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">VersionTest</span></code> test module and lay down some boilerplate:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule BitcoinNetwork.Protocol.VersionTest do
  use ExUnit.Case

  alias BitcoinNetwork.Protocol
  alias BitcoinNetwork.Protocol.{Message, Version}
end
</code></pre>

<p>Next, we’ll add our test:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
test "parses a version payload" do
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we’ll need to do is load the data from our exported version packet binary:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
assert {:ok, packet} = File.read("test/fixtures/version.bin")
</code></pre>

<p>We use Elixir’s <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/File.html#read/1"><code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code></a> to read the contents of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">version</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bin</span></code> file, and assert that we’ll receive an <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:ok</span></code> tuple containing the binary contents of our file in our new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">packet</span></code> assignment.</p>

<div class="post-footer">
    <div class="signup-form">
        <form action="http://east5th.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=f8833fd40e2b1b28545d9f382&id=c56ceba687" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank">

                                                                                                           --><input type="email" value="" name="EMAIL" id="mce-EMAIL" /><!--
                                                                                                                                                                                                    --><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" />
            </div>
            <div><input type="text" name="b_f8833fd40e2b1b28545d9f382_c56ceba687" tabindex="-1" value="" /></div>
        </form>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Next, we’ll parse the binary, just like we do within our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Node</span></code> with a call to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Message</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parse</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
assert {:ok, message, &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;} = Message.parse(packet)
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, we assert that we’ll receive an <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="ss">:ok</span></code> tuple with our resulting <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">message</span></code>. Because the data we exported from Wireshark relates specifically to our version packet, we expect the list of remaining, unparsed binary data to be empty (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="o">&lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;</span></code>).</p>

<p>Now that we’ve parsed the message, we can compare the resulting <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Version</span></code> struct found in <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">message</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parsed_payload</span></code> with a pre-defined, expected <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">version</span></code> struct and assert that they’re equal:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
assert message.parsed_payload == version
</code></pre>

<p>But where does <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">version</span></code> come from? How can we know the contents of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">version</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bin</span></code> packet without manually parsing it ourselves, byte by byte?</p>

<h2 id="interpreting-our-fixtures">Interpreting Our Fixtures</h2>

<p>Once again, Wireshark comes to the rescue. In addition to letting us export our Bitcoin packets as raw binaries, Wireshark also lets us inspect the parsed contents of each of our Bitcoin packets.</p>

<p>If we go back to our version packet in our Wireshark capture file, we can open up the “Bitcoin protocol” section and see a complete breakdown of not only the high level message metadata, but also the specific information sent along in the version message:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/generating-test-fixtures-with-wireshark/04.png" />
  <p>Filtering for bitcoin packets.</p>
</div>

<p>We can use this information to construct our pre-defined <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">version</span></code> struct at the top of our test:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
version = %Version{
  version: 70015,
  services: 13,
  timestamp: 1_528_146_756,
  recv_ip: &lt;&lt;0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 255, 255, 160, 16, 233, 215&gt;&gt;,
  recv_port: 18333,
  recv_services: 9,
  from_ip: &lt;&lt;0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0&gt;&gt;,
  from_port: 0,
  from_services: 13,
  nonce: 15_116_783_876_185_394_608,
  user_agent: "/Satoshi:0.14.2/",
  start_height: 1_322_730
}
</code></pre>

<p>And with that, we have a solid test of our version parsing functionality.</p>

<h2 id="testing-serialization">Testing Serialization</h2>

<p>We can test the serialization of our version packet much like we tested the parsing functionality.</p>

<p>Let’s start off by adding a new test to our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">VersionTest</span></code> module:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
test "serializes a version struct" do
end
</code></pre>

<p>Once again, we’ll start off by using <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">File</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">read</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> to load our binary fixture, and using <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Message</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parse</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> to parse the resulting binary:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
assert {:ok, packet} = File.read("test/fixtures/version.bin")
assert {:ok, message, &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt;} = Message.parse(packet)
</code></pre>

<p>Rather than comparing the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">message</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parsed_payload</span></code> to some pre-defined <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Version</span></code> struct, we’ll instead serialize it with a call to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Protocol</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">serialize</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> and compare the newly serialized version against the message’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">payload</span></code> binary:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
assert Protocol.serialize(message.parsed_payload) == message.payload
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s it!</p>

<p>If our version serialization code is working correctly, it should return a binary identical to the version portion of the packet exported from Wireshark.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I’d like to give a huge shout out to <a href="http://blog.lucidsimple.com/2014/08/14/binary-fixtures-with-wireshark.html">Lucid Simple’s article on “Binary Fixtures with Wireshark”</a>. It was a huge inspiration for me and a very well written article. I highly recommend you check it out if you’d like a more in-depth exploration of using Wireshark-generated binary fixtures.</p>

<p>For what it’s worth, this kind of testing has already resulted in a positive return on investment. Shortly after implementing these tests, I noticed that my version struct was incorrectly serializing messages, resulting in some strange behavior I’d been noticing with my node. Using the tests as a guide, I was able to quickly fix my implementation.</p>

<p>Three cheers for testing!</p></p>

<div>
<p>Recall the standard <code>ReLU</code> function from neural networks:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$
\texttt{ReLU}(x) = \max(0, x) = \begin{cases}
    x &amp; x &gt; 0 \\
    0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
$$</span><br /></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>All well-and-good. But what if I want to apply a function to the lower-half of this function, instead of setting it to <span class="math inline">0</span>? Infact, what if I want to apply a function to the top-half as well! And while we’re at it, why should the inflexion point be <span class="math inline">0</span> always?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, here’s the <code>fugu</code> function:</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$
\texttt{fugu}(x, f, g, p) = \begin{cases}
    g(x) &amp; x &gt; p \\
    f(x) &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
$$</span><br /></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Then, <span class="math inline"><code>ReLU</code>(<em>x</em>)=<code>fugu</code>(<em>x</em>, 0, id, 0)</span>, if you wish.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Here’s the <code>fugu</code> function in Python TensorFlow:</p>
</div>
<div>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> fugu (x, f, g<span class="op">=</span><span class="kw">lambda</span> x: x, point<span class="op">=</span><span class="dv">0</span>):
    cond   <span class="op">=</span> tf.less(x, point)
    <span class="cf">return</span> tf.where(cond, f(x), g(x))</code></pre></div>
</div>
<div>
<p>There, <code>tf.nn.relu(x) = fugu(x, tf.zeros_like)</code>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>What kinds of cool/useful functions can you build with this?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Exercise: Can you use the <code>fugu</code> function to build a kind of “stairway-to-relu” function?</p>

<h4><a href="https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-06-05-mailing-list-vs-github.html">Mailing lists vs Github</a></h4>
<p>
<p>Most fledgling open source projects use Github or Gitlab to collaborate on code. However there’s an older method that developers ought to know about because it offers some advantages.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="https://begriffs.com/images/gh-vs-mail.png" alt="Github vs Email" />
<p class="caption">Github vs Email</p>
</div>
<p>The alternative method is the developer mailing list. It arose in the late eighties to early nineties, and predates the popularity of the web browser. But far from being a mere historical curiosity, the discussion list is still the primary method of development in many important open source projects, from databases to operating systems to web browsers.</p>
<p>In this article I’ll carefully compare the use of mailing lists with code collaboration web sites such as Github. I’ll do my best to present the pros and cons of each, so that projects assessing the two can make an informed decision.</p>
<h3 id="briefly-how-does-each-work">Briefly, how does each work?</h3>
<p>Github hosts a git server, a bug tracker, a wiki, as well as release artifacts. Participation in discussions or code changes requires a Github identity. Code changes are proposed by making another Github-hosted project (a “fork”), modifying a remote branch, and using the GUI to open a pull request from your branch to the original. Project members debate the change in comments, with subsequent changes pushed as commits to the pull request branch. Ultimately a project owner can decide to merge the commits.</p>
<p>A mailing list maintains a list of subscribers who receive all messages sent to a “reflector” email address. A project must host its own version control server elsewhere. Code changes are proposed by sending an email to the reflector, with a textual diff of the changes either attached or inline. List members debate the change with email replies, sending subsequent changes as more diffs, either to replace or amend the original. Ultimately a project committer can decide to apply the patch(es) to the codebase.</p>
<h3 id="advantages-of-mailing-lists">Advantages of mailing lists</h3>
<h4 id="precise-flexible-communication">Precise, flexible communication</h4>
<p>Mailing lists have three properties that allow developers to communicate with greater precision and flexibility than is possible in the Github UI: the threaded nature of emails, the user generation of patches, and the free mixing of discussion and patches.</p>
<h5 id="threading">Threading</h5>
<p>The Github web UI has a limited model of threading, where there is one thread for the pull request as a whole, and other threads attached to single changed lines of code. The UI shows a few lines of code for context around the line chosen for discussion, but the full chunk of code under discussion must be inferred.</p>
<p>Email sub-threads allow specialized discussion about different aspects or sections of the code. A linear Github-style discussion would mix those conversations.</p>
<p>Conversations over email have a greater permanence and reference value than Github comments. On Github, comments continually change. They become “outdated” and disappear when attached to a line that has been changed. Same for the commits, which vanish after a force-push to the pull request branch. In an email thread, by contrast, the original messages and proposed changes remain for comparison with later messages and patches.</p>
<p>Furthermore, patches from multiple authors can’t mix in a Github pull request. The person opening the pull request “owns” it. Other participants can drop code suggestions as comments, but what gets merged by the UI is ultimately the commits on the branch. The pull requester must turn those comments into commits on the branch if he or she wants to incorporate the suggested changes.</p>
<p>On a mailing list, anyone is free to reply to an existing thread with a new proposed set of patches. Another nice effect is that other people can carry the patch to the finish line if the original author stops caring or being involved. (I’ve encountered a number of MIA authors in pull requests on my projects over the years.)</p>
<h5 id="patch-format">Patch Format</h5>
<p>Custom patches are another way that the email process improves communication over the Github UI. Contributors can shape the patches to make them more readable for other people.</p>
<p>With Github you commit your changes and then Github chooses how to render the diff to the reviewer, but when creating the patch yourself you can tweak the settings. Diffs can be in <em>unified</em> or <em>context</em> format, and for the latter the number of context lines is configurable. (To be fair, Github allows expanding the view of context around changes too.)</p>
<p>Some people feel that git-style unified diffs are clearest for small changes of a few lines, and context diffs are more suitable for changing larger ranges, especially lines with indentation changes. (To be fair, I should note that Github will hide indentation changes if you add <code>?w=1</code> to the URL displaying the change.)</p>
<p>Finally, creating patches by hand with <code>diff</code> can take advantage of other options, like annotating the hunk headers with which C functions are affected (using the <code>-p</code> flag), and the choice of <a href="http://fabiensanglard.net/git_code_review/diff.php">various algorithms</a> such as “patience.”</p>
<p>Patience does a little more work to calculate its results, but the output makes more sense for humans. For instance, a standard (non-patience) diff might look like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode diff"><code class="sourceCode diff"> void func1() {
     x += 1
<span class="va">+}</span>
<span class="va">+</span>
<span class="va">+void functhreehalves() {</span>
<span class="va">+    x += 1.5</span>
 }

 void func2() {
     x += 2
 }</code></pre></div>
<p>Whereas a patience diff shows the function added as a unit:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode diff"><code class="sourceCode diff"> void func1() {
     x += 1
 }

<span class="va">+void functhreehalves() {</span>
<span class="va">+    x += 1.5</span>
<span class="va">+}</span>
<span class="va">+</span>
 void func2() {
     x += 2
 }</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, there’s nothing to stop the mailing list style of collaboration from adapting to emerging diff formats, such as <a href="https://begriffs.com/posts/2014-04-08-pilgrimage-report-structural-merging.html">structural diffs</a>. That’s because patches in emails directly describe changes whereas Github renders commit deltas without nuance.</p>
<h5 id="patchdiscussion-mix">Patch/Discussion mix</h5>
<p>The bulk of communication around a new feature is in its proposal, not around the subsequent code. A contributor proposes the feature, justifies it, and confirms the scope before writing any code. The community responds, and often by the time anyone implements anything, the idea has shifted significantly from the start of the process.</p>
<p>This is again where emails fit the group discussion well, with inline replies and the threaded structure as mentioned above. When it’s time to get coding there’s no discontinuity of switching from an “issue” to a “pull request.” The author simply replies again with patches attached.</p>
<h4 id="control-and-customization">Control and customization</h4>
<p>While web apps deliver a centrally-controlled user interface, native applications allow each person to customize their own experience. Open protocols like SMTP encourage a proliferation of clients. So it is with with mail clients, each providing its own functions, filters, folders, flags and fun. Mail clients provide ways to mark a message important, or set it back as unread. In general you don’t have to unsuccessfully beg a central committee over five years for an interface change. (It happens, see this <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/github/issues/50">petition</a> in an unofficial repo designed to supplicate the Github deities.)</p>
<p>Some people script their mail client so that they can apply patches with a keyboard shortcut, others go minimalist, and still others even use webmail. Each person is different, and so is their software, but the nature of the mailing list allows them all to work together.</p>
<p>Another area of control is the ability to search and interact with a mailing list while offline. This is often by choice rather than necessity. Urban and suburban areas usually have internet access available anywhere at any time, using cellular service if need be. Things are no longer as they once were with intermittent dial-up connections, but working offline is a choice that some people simply prefer.</p>
<p>Although git is itself distributed and operates locally without a network connection, Github requires connectivity to review issues and pull requests. Demanding connectivity for an essentially reflective solitary task is unreasonable.</p>
<p>Remember that being online applies in two directions: the developer’s connection to the internet and also Github’s uptime. Although the latter has been pretty stable for a while, I do remember a handful of times where my entire office got derailed by Github downtime. Taking Github down is a big attractive target for angry nations and ambitious hackers.</p>
<p>With a native email client you can review all emails and attachments offline. You can even send replies to messages offline and the client will queue them until internet access becomes available.</p>
<p>For the other side, the uptime of the mailing list server, mail sent to an offline server will eventually go through. Mail transfer agents along the email chain are designed to retry transmissions. In addition, developer lists recommend that users “Reply All” to messages so that everyone involved in a thread as well as the list reflector address get the message. That way even if the reflector is offline, your email can go through to those most recently involved.</p>
<p>Ultimately the control and customizability enjoyed by the mailing list style of development comes from diverse tools built for open standards. Patchfiles are universally supported (git itself directly <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch">supports</a> <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-am">patches</a>), SMTP has an RFC. Tools can work together, rather than having a GUI locked in the browser.</p>
<h4 id="politics-and-profit">Politics and Profit</h4>
<p>Git was originally created as an escape from BitKeeper, a version control system with associated centralized hosting. BitKeeper granted a free license for open source projects, and required projects to store their metadata on company servers.</p>
<p>What a twist of history, then, that users of git chose Github… a centralized host granting free licenses for open source projects, and requiring projects to store their metadata on company servers.</p>
<p>Github can legally delete projects or users with or without cause. This makes sense of course, since the projects are using computers owned by Github. Also, while not explicitly prohibiting development of competing projects like BitKeeper did, Github can still view the private source code of all companies who choose to host with them.</p>
<p>Really, what’s the future of Github (or any profit-driven yet free code hosting service)? History provides the example of SourceForge, the premier code collaboration platform at the turn of the century. After acquisition by dice.com, and in a last-ditch effort to grab some more money, SourceForge hijacked hosted projects so that their installers would include adware and spyware.</p>
<p>When I first began notes for this article, the implications for Github were purely hypothetical, but even as of this writing news has emerged that Microsoft is buying Github. It doesn’t feel far-fetched to suggest that Github may be moving into its “SourceForge stage.”</p>
<p>Let this lesson be broader than Github though. The same logic applies to other web platforms that centralize and combine programmer communication and hosting.</p>
<p>Some major open source projects like the PostgreSQL database played it safe and explicitly chose never to put their code on external company servers (other than for mirroring). Postgres also takes pains to place control in a governing body spanning multiple companies. No company is allowed a majority of committers, and the organization is designed to survive independently.</p>
<p>Not all projects are important enough to require this level of neutrality, but all projects deserve to control their own destiny.</p>
<h4 id="right-tool-for-the-job">Right tool for the job</h4>
<p>The fundamental task we’re talking about is asynchronous group communication of code changes. Patches are a universally understood way of describing code changes, and email is a universally understood method of communication. So it seems that this approach matches the problem at hand.</p>
<p>In fact emailing patches works with any version control system, not just Git. The OpenBSD project still happily uses mailing lists with CVS. Patch authors don’t need any version control software installed at all. An author can download the source release tarball, make changes in the copy, capture the diff, and email it.</p>
<p>Sending and applying patches cuts out busywork like cleaning up remote branches after merge, or creating a local branch in the forked repo in preparation for a pull request. For comparison, I remember teaching a group of new programmers how to use Github, and was conscious at the time of all the weird steps I asked them to do.</p>
<p>There’s also less busywork for finished communications. There aren’t things to “clean up” like abandoned pull requests, merged branches, or issues to mark closed. The replies just stop on those threads. More on some downsides of this later, but for now look on the bright side.</p>
<p>Using email also decouples digital identity from the accounts on a site like Github, and ultimately places that trust in the DNS system managed by an international organization, ICANN. For more about this, see my article <a href="https://begriffs.com/posts/2016-07-08-returning-original-social-network.html">Returning to the Original Social Network</a>. PGP provides a further guarantee of identity, verified through a decentralized web of trust. See my recording of Neal Walfield’s talk <a href="https://begriffs.com/posts/2016-11-05-advanced-intro-gnupg.html">An Advanced Intro to GnuPG</a>.</p>
<h3 id="challenges-for-mailing-lists">Challenges for mailing lists</h3>
<p>The mailing list approach raises quite a few questions and difficulties. I’ve done my best to try to acknowledge them and suggest possible solutions.</p>
<h4 id="unfamiliarity-and-obscurity">Unfamiliarity and obscurity</h4>
<h5 id="variety-of-process">Variety of process</h5>
<p>When you browse a Github project you know exactly how it works. Sure, the addons/CI/hooks may differ, and setting up the project might involve some contortions, but the process of browsing code, finding known bugs, and submitting changes is always the same. This is most definitely not true for projects with their own web presence and mailing lists.</p>
<p>I’ve heard people go so far as to say, “If a project is not on Github then there is a 0% chance that I will contribute.” To be honest I can’t say that I’ve contributed to non-Github projects either. After I migrated to Github from Google Code my only non-Github contributions (if you want to call them that) were filing a bug report for Chrome, and another for a tool on Gitlab.</p>
<p>One more source of unfamiliarity is that many people, especially younger devs, have never seen a real mail client like <code>mutt</code>. In their minds they may picture an overflowing GMail inbox full of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posting_style#Top-posting">top posted</a> replies all mixed together from different projects. That’s not an enticing image. Perhaps this article can start these developers on the path to rediscovering the care and engineering that went into classic email clients (“MUAs” as they are called).</p>
<p>Given the unfamiliarity, a self-hosted project needs to communicate very clearly how it does collaboration. A mailing list alone is not enough; a project needs to explain itself on the web, and provide information about getting involved.</p>
<p>A final note about unfamiliarity. Beware that offline users can be misunderstood in today’s connected age. It can look silly to write an email while offline, only to have it queue, send, and arrive after another better response renders yours unnecessary. It’s probably wise to include a signature line saying something like, “Note: composed offline, may lack recent context.”</p>
<h5 id="social-proof">Social proof</h5>
<p>The next problem that projects outside Github face is the lack of social proof through star voting. It’s harder for new projects to build reputation without stars. People take notice of a project with thousands of stars in a way that the mere project description doesn’t evoke. While much established software like OSes, browsers, and databases do fine without the stars, they won their acceptance years ago, or are promoted by big companies.</p>
<p>One way to help self-hosted project popularity is to hook into Github without going too deep. What some projects like git and Linux do is run their own servers, but offer a read-only mirror on Github for public admiration and code browsing.</p>
<p>Two tools that can help are the <a href="http://nopullrequests.com/">Pull Request Rejection Bot</a> and the built-in setting to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/disabling-issues/">disable issues</a>. After disabling pull requests and issues, the project README needs to include information about how and where to contribute.</p>
<p>The self-hosted git server will also need a post-commit hook to keep Github up to date. This command should do the trick in the hook:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="fu">git</span> push github_remote -f --mirror</code></pre></div>
<h4 id="disorganization">Disorganization</h4>
<h5 id="patch-state">Patch state</h5>
<p>A big difficulty for mailing lists is sharing the global state of email threads. Not the content of the messages, obviously, but the decisions that require action. Individual contributors can flag messages for action in their mail clients, but this status remains private for each individual. It’s helpful to record publicly that a patch has been accepted for future application, or that a previously reported bug was fixed.</p>
<p>Projects do this in one of two ways: adding metadata to the git repository itself, or using an external tool that ties into the mailing list.</p>
<p>For instance PostgreSQL had a problem where patches hung around without being accepted or rejected (there are up to ~250 proposed patches to consider at one time!). So the team created <a href="https://commitfest.postgresql.org/">commitfest.postgresql.org</a>. Contributors now register the patches on this site for final review. Several times per year committers stop their own work and make time to accept/defer/reject/apply the patches.</p>
<p><a href="http://jk.ozlabs.org/projects/patchwork/">Patchwork</a> is a similar tool that is not tied to Postgres and is more suitable for general use. Patchwork supplements a mailing list by subscribing to the list just like a person would, and capturing patches from the emails. For each patch it creates a web page. It doesn’t fragment discussion because it doesn’t allow commenting through the web interface, it merely reflects any comments from the emails, and allows maintainers to mark patches with a state such as Accepted, Rejected, or Under Review.</p>
<h5 id="comprehensive-bug-list">Comprehensive bug list</h5>
<p>Here’s something surprising I just learned: the PostgreSQL project does not have any place a new contributor can go to find a list of open bugs for the project. There is a separate mailing list, pgsql-bugs, where people report them, but there’s nothing that ties that with the activity on pgsql-hackers to indicate whether the bug is resolved. Interestingly, OpenBSD also has a <code>bugs</code> email list and no central bug status.</p>
<p>Postgres is still searching for a system which matches how they like to work and which doesn’t detract from the mailing lists. I don’t believe OpenBSD desires a bug tracker. As they quipped on IRC, “If we did [have one] we would be FreeBSD, wouldn’t we?”</p>
<p>For projects that do want a bug tracker, one good contender is <a href="https://www.debian.org/Bugs/">Debbugs</a> from the Debian project. It provides an email interface to manipulate the bugs and can be used for projects other than Debian.</p>
<p>Other bug systems work by adding files or objects into the project git repo itself. Thus fixing a bug on a branch could mean deleting the bug from the repo along with the other changes on that branch. Like email, this preserves offline access to bug information. Probably one of the best is <a href="http://bugseverywhere.org/">Bugs Everywhere</a>. Another pretty clean one is simply called <a href="https://github.com/driusan/bug">bug</a>.</p>
<h5 id="message-history">Message history</h5>
<p>Once you subscribe to a mailing list, new messages flow into your client and are available for searching. Hooray! But what about messages sent before you joined the list? Furthermore, how do you “link” to old messages from newer ones? Every issue on Github has its own URL, so issues can refer to each other, but how would an email say something like, “we already discussed this in message X, look there.”?</p>
<p>The way this works is with the <code>Message-ID</code> header. Every email has one, and they are part of how replies work. They are big GUIDs that look like <code>8953.1527887111@sss.pgh.pa.us</code> or <code>CAFjFpReKyYrsUF8sP5GoPYyyp9ZSqm_mLeD8kQLigX-3CzDiUg@mail.gmail.com</code>. So an email could say, “We discussed this issue in 8953.1527887111@sss.pgh.pa.us, let’s move the discussion there.”</p>
<p>Reading a message sent prior to your joining the list requires going to the list archive on the web. Good archives provide links to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">mbox</a> files which can be imported into a native mail client. This makes the old messages available for search/reply in the mail client. Archives also usually provide a web interface to read the messages as HTML, but navigating threads in these old interfaces is usually way more painful than in a good mail client.</p>
<p>As an example, check out the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-hackers/">archives</a> for pgsql-hackers. Notice the mbox file links. You can download an mbox for a month’s worth of messages, for individual messages or for full threads. To navigate to a certain message id, use the url <code>https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/:the-id</code>. Try one of the ids I listed earlier. Similarly the Linux kernel mailing list archives can display a message by id via <code>lkml.kernel.org</code>.</p>
<p>Remember that all emails have a Message-ID header, this isn’t something special having to do with mailing lists. If you want to <em>reply</em> to a message that’s not imported in your mail client, you need to include the email header <code>In-Reply-To: &lt;message-id&gt;</code> or the thread will be split, regardless of the subject line you use.</p>
<h5 id="external-tools">External tools</h5>
<p>Email and patch files are both old interoperable standards, so, theoretically, running patches through continuous integration ought not to be a problem. However I don’t know that the tooling here is well-developed. Where Gitlab has a CI server built in, and several addons exist for Github, I don’t know of any clearly dominant thing for a patch based workflow. IBM built a tool called <a href="https://github.com/ruscur/snowpatch">snowpatch</a> to do this, but I don’t know what tomfoolery is involved.</p>
<p>It is possible to read patches from a list and then script an integration to a CI tool via patching and pushing to Github. Thomas Munro recently created <a href="http://cfbot.cputube.org/">cfbot</a> to do this for Postgres. (See the interesting <a href="https://www.pgcon.org/2018/schedule/attachments/499_pgcon%202018%20-%20continuous%20integration.pdf">slides</a> about its development.) It’s a creative use for Github that doesn’t compromise the mailing list flow.</p>
<h4 id="barrier-to-entry">Barrier to entry</h4>
<p>Related to the unfamiliarity mentioned earlier, using a mailing list well requires new skills for contributors, and infrastructure for maintainers.</p>
<h5 id="tooling-and-the-protocol">Tooling and the protocol</h5>
<p>Although you can subscribe to a list with Outlook or GMail and call it a day, neither you nor the people you interact with will be happy about it. Email is a precise tool from ye olde Unix days, where people care about things like the plain text lines you send over the wire, or the way you use MIME types.</p>
<p>But even before crafting these little RFC-821 gems you have to go through a dance every time you want to subscribe to a list, confirming your address and adding a folder and filter to the mail client. It’s not like jotting a note in the issues of another Github repo, unless the mailing list is “open” meaning accepts mail from non-registered addresses. Most lists are “closed” because of spam. Such is the price we pay for basing identity on the DNS system and not on a corporate collaborative coding site profile.</p>
<p>Once on the list and ready to send some messages or patches, there are a few guidelines to follow that pretty much all lists ask. They help accommodate the diversity of mail clients:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send with plain text</li>
<li>Disable all HTML “enhancements”</li>
<li>At most 72 characters per line</li>
<li>Do not top-post</li>
<li>Keep quoted text small and relevant</li>
<li>Strip out company legal footers</li>
<li>Shorten lengthy signatures</li>
<li>Use Reply-All</li>
<li>If replying, ensure <code>In-Reply-To</code> is set</li>
</ul>
<p>If your message contains a patch then there are more rules to observe, and they vary by community. Linux, OpenBSD and FreeBSD say, “No MIME, no links, no compression, no attachments. Just plain text.” The patch goes right in the body of the message at the bottom. If the mail client would mangle the code (such as by wrapping long lines), then attaching with MIME is permissible. For patches above 300kb, host them online and include a link.</p>
<p>Postgres, on the other hand, wants patches attached as type <code>text/x-patch</code>, with <code>disposition: inline</code> for tiny patches and <code>disposition: attachment</code> for substantial ones. And in both cases including a unique filename for the patch in the Content-Disposition. Also different reviewers prefer different patch formats, like Tom Lane will only accept context diffs, but other people want unified diffs.</p>
<h5 id="hosting-requirements">Hosting requirements</h5>
<p>On the maintainer side, it’s not as easy to make a new project as it is clicking a button on Github. Maintainers need to host the mailing list and <em>optionally</em> a patch status app and a bug tracker.</p>
<p>I’d advise creating a general purpose listserv for your personal use, which can run lists for all your small projects. Then create project pages off your homepage or something. I just can’t see taking the overhead to spin up new infrastructure for a dinky experimental open source utility.</p>
<p>There are probably commercially hosted listservs for rent, or you can host your own. Probably the best ones for self-hosting are <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/mailman/">GNU Mailman</a> or <a href="http://mlmmj.org/">Mlmmj</a>. There’s also a service called <a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/">The Mail Archive</a> which can add an archive to any list. Might also be worth looking into <a href="https://public-inbox.org/README.html">public-inbox</a> which is a new approach that shares a mailbox itself over Git. Git to hold the mailing list to talk about git – inception!</p>
<p>For your listserv you’ll also want to install Spamassassin and restrict allowed MIME types to plain text and patches. Also remember to configure the list to use <code>Reply-To</code> rather than <code>From</code> for DMARC compatibility. This whole ordeal isn’t something you want to have to do twice!</p>
<p>Optionally you may want to host a lightweight web interface for browsing git. The simplest seem to be one of these:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">cgit</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git.2f30.org/stagit/">stagit</a></li>
<li><a href="http://klausdemo.lophus.org/klaus/">klaus</a></li>
<li><a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-GitWeb">GitWeb</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Alternately you could just use Github for the actual git server and code browsing. Or mirror there.</p>
<p>Finally, you could go really hard-core and let people use git’s builtin functionality for pulling a shallow clone rather than providing any web interface:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode bash"><code class="sourceCode bash"><span class="co"># get the latest commit</span>
<span class="fu">git</span> clone --depth=1 --single-branch --branch master <span class="op">&lt;</span>remote<span class="op">&gt;</span>

<span class="co"># or get it and don't even include the .git folder</span>
<span class="fu">git</span> archive --remote=<span class="op">&lt;</span>remote<span class="op">&gt;</span> master</code></pre></div>
<p>This is rather unfriendly though.</p>
<h4 id="topic-specialization">Topic specialization</h4>
<p>Sometimes it’s useful to restrict the general purpose nature of email messages. For instance bug reports should follow a certain format and include details about the environment. Github offers <a href="https://blog.github.com/2016-02-17-issue-and-pull-request-templates/">issue templates</a>; what’s the equivalent for email?</p>
<p>Some projects address this with helper programs that collect information and format an email on your behalf. The information is thus specialized for the type of software involved. GNU has <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/gnats/">GNATS</a>, OpenBSD has <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/sendbug">sendbug</a>, Debian has <a href="https://www.debian.org/Bugs/">debbugs</a> and Postgres has a bug <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/account/submitbug/">report form</a>.</p>
<p>Noob questions are another kind of specialized topic, as are topics that interest only a small subset of the list. Lists full of kernel developers or database hackers tend to be… stern. Communities which still use mailing lists are usually the ones full of scary wizards who invent the world that the rest of us play in. Thus it can be intimidating to ask basic questions there. What projects usually do is create a beginner list separate from the main developer zone. Also IRC is a good way to ask questions that fade away.</p>
<h4 id="why-not-nntp">Why not NNTP?</h4>
<p>Isn’t the whole email list concept a bit of a hack for turning a protocol designed for small-group communication into a behemoth? After all, NNTP is made for threaded large group discussion.</p>
<p>NNTP has slightly worse offline characteristics though. While email allows the Reply-All trick to keep things limping along during a list outage, replies through NNTP have to route through a central server. Also identity verification needs to happen on the server, whereas email can delegate to SPF/DKIM/DMARC. There are also a greater number of clients for email than NNTP, and clients that continue to be supported.</p>
<p>Finally, if you like reading a mailing list with a newsreader, go right ahead. Use a bridge like <a href="http://www.gmane.org/">GMANE</a>.</p>
<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>
<p>I hope that I’ve given mailing lists a fair comparison with today’s more common web interfaces. It seems that mailing lists offer real advantages, and that some projects could benefit from making the switch. The biggest difficulty with mailing lists seems to be simply setting them up. Perhaps if there was a deployable server image including necessary software and configuration, that would help boost adoption.</p></p>
